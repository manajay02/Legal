ORDER 

P.Kumararatnam,J. 

The  Petitioner  who  is  the  Suspect  named  in  the  Magistrate  Court  of 

Maligakanda Case No. B 10466/22 had applied for bail for him.  

On  07.04.2022,  the  Petitioner  was  arrested  by  the  officers  attached  to 

Divisional Investigation Unit of North Colombo when he was driving a car 

bearing No. WP CAW 1611 near a hotel named Vani Villas, Kotahena. At 

the time of his arrest, the Petitioner was alleged to be in possession of 

495  grams  of  Methamphetamine  and  8.583  kilograms  of  Hashish.  The 

Petitioner  is  an  Indian  national  holding  an  Indian  Passport  bearing

number  V5429645  and  he  was  handed  over  to  the  Police  Narcotics 

Bureau for further investigation. Further, the Suspect was placed under 

a detention order.         

The Petitioner was produced and facts were reported to the Maligakanda 

Magistrate under Section 54A (d) and (b) and of the Poisons, Opium and 

Dangerous Drugs Ordinance as amended by the Act No.13 of 1984. 

The production had been sent to the Government Analyst Department on 

25/04/2022. After analysis, the Government Analyst had forwarded the 

report to Court. According to the Government Analyst, pure 395.5 grams 

of  Methamphetamine  8.5066  kilograms  of  Hashish  had  been  detected 

from the substance sent for the analysis.   

Trail  has  not  been  commenced  and  no  indictment  filed  in  Court  up  to 

now. He has been in remand for nearly about three years.  

The Petitioner has pleaded following exceptional circumstances in 

support of this Bail Application.  

1.  The Petitioner has been in remand custody since 07.04.2022.       

2.  The Petitioner was subjected to serious assault and pleads that no 

narcotics substance recovered from him. 

3.  No proper investigation has been done by the police. 

4.  He is in remand custody without any legal action.   

The State opposing to bail  submitted  that the indictment pertaining to 

the offences under the Poisons, Opium and Dangerous Drugs Act will be 

expeditiously considered upon receiving the IBEs from the Police Narcotic 

Bureau. Hence, Learned State Counsel submitted that the delay is not 

an exceptional circumstance to be considered to enlarge the Suspect on 

bail.  Further,  the  time  spent  for  preparing  the  indictment  does  not 

constitute an exceptional circumstance.  

The  suspect  is  in  remand  for  nearly  03  years.  According  to  the 

Government Analyst Report, the pure quantity of Methamphetamine and 

3 | P a g e  

 
 
CA Bail 330-2024 

Hashish   detected from the possession of the Petitioner is 395.5 grams 

and 8.5066 Kg respectively.  

The  exceptional  circumstances  are  not  defined  in  the  statute.  Hence, 

what is exceptional circumstances must be considered on its own facts 

and circumstances on a case by case. 

In  Ramu  Thamodarampillai  v.  The  Attorney  General  [2004]  3  SLR 

180 the court held that: 

“the decision must in each case depend on its own peculiar facts and 

circumstances”.  

The Section 83 of the Poison, Opium and Dangerous Drugs Act which 

was amended by Act No. 41 of 2022 states: 

 83. (1) Subject to the provisions of sections 84, 85 and subsection (2) of 

this section, a person suspected or accused of an offence under sections 

54A and 54B of this Ordinance, shall not be released on bail by the High 

Court except in exceptional circumstances.  

(2)  Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of  sections  84  and  85,  a  person 

suspected or accused of an offence under subsection (1) of section 54A 

and section 54B- 

(a)  of  which  the  pure  quantity  of  the  dangerous  drug,  trafficked, 

imported, exported, or possessed is ten grammes or above in terms 

of the report issued by the Government Analyst under section 77A; 

and 

(b) which is punishable with death or life imprisonment,  

shall not be released on bail except by the Court of Appeal in exceptional 

circumstances.

CA Bail 330-2024 

In  this  case,  the  pure  quantity  of  Methamphetamine  detected  in  the 

production by the Government Analyst is 395.5 grams. Hence, this court 

has jurisdiction to consider granting of bail as per the new amendment. 

The  Counsel  for  the  Petitioner  submits  that  undue  and  long  delay  in 

keeping the Petitioner in remand custody is a clear violation of his human 

rights and is against the presumption of innocence guaranteed under the 

Article 13(5) of the Constitution. 

The  Offence  under  Section  54A(d)  and  (b)  of  the  Poisons  Opium  and 

Dangerous Drugs Ordinance as amended by the Act No.13 of 1984 is a 

serious offence and the seriousness of the offence should be considered 

when bail is considered.  

In  Ranil  Charuka  Kulatunga  v.  Attorney  General  CA  (PHC)  APN 

134/2015 the court held that: 

“The quantity of cocaine involved in this case is 62.847 grams, 

which is a commercial quantity. If Petitioner is convicted, the 

punishment  is  death  or  life  imprisonment.  Under  these 

circumstances, it is prudent to conclude the trial early while 

the Petitioner is kept in custody.” 

In  this  case  the  pure  Methamphetamine  is  395.5  grams  and  certainly 

very  high  commercial  quantities.  Considering  the  seriousness  of  the 

sentence  prescribed  under  the  Poison,  Opium  and  Dangerous  Drugs 

Ordinance, there is a high risk of absconding as the Petitioner is a foreign 

national. Hence, it is prudent to conclude his case expeditiously keeping 

the Petitioner in remand.  

Hence, I do not consider the delay nearly three years in remand falls into 

the  category  of  excessive  and  oppressive  delay  considering  the 

circumstances of this case. 

5 | P a g e  

 
 
 
 
CA Bail 330-2024 

Considering all these factors into account, especially the pure quantity 

of  Methamphetamine  and  Hashish  detected,  the  charges  going  to  be 

framed  against  the  Petitioner  and  other  circumstances  of  the  case,  I 

consider this is not an appropriate case to sanction bail to the Petitioner 

at this stage. Hence, I refuse to release the Petitioner on bail. 

Hence, this Bail Application is dismissed. 

The Registrar of this Court is directed to send this order to Maligakanda 

Magistrate Court and Officer-in-Charge of the Police Narcotics Bureau, 

Colombo-01. 

K.M.S,Dissanayake J.   

I agree.
