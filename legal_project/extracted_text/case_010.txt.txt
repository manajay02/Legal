The
(hereinafter referred to as the Respondent) on 23-04-2005 under and in
terms of the Muslim Marriage and Divorce Act, No. 13 of 1951 (as
amended). There are three children born out of this marriage, namely,
Mohamed Ameen Alfa (17 years), Mohamed Ameen Amhar (13 years) and
Mohamed Ameen Aaliya (4 years). During the pendency of this marriage,
the Respondent (husband) contracted another marriage and neglected to
maintain the Petitioner and the said three children. Therefore, the
Petitioner made an application on 17-06-2020 before the learned Quazi
of Negombo claiming maintenance for herself and the children. Upon the
application made by the Respondent, the Judicial Service Commission
transferred the said application to the learned Quazi of Colombo East.

After inquiry, the learned Quazi of Colombo East, on 11-06-2022 ordered
the Respondent to pay a sum of Rs. 15,000/- to the Petitioner and a total
sum of Rs. 45,000/- (20,000+15,000+10,000) per month for the children
as maintenance, from the date of application.

Since the Respondent failed to comply with the said Order, the learned
Quazi
issued an enforcement certificate dated 19-10-2022 to the
Magistrate’s Court of Negombo to recover a sum of Rs. 1,740,000/-being
the accrued arrears of maintenance for the period between 19-06-2020 to
15-10-2022.

Thereupon,
the Respondent on 26-10-2022 invoked the revisionary
jurisdiction of the Board of Quazis seeking to set aside the said Order of
the learned Quazi. Subsequently, the Respondent filed an amended
Petition and moved for an interim order to stay all the proceedings both
in the Quazi Court of Colombo East and the Magistrate’s Court of
Negombo. The Board of Quazi, on 20-05-2023, issued an interim Order
staying all proceedings in the Quazi Court of Colombo East and Ordered
the said Quazi to recall the said certificate of enforcement filed in the

Page 3 of 5

Magistrate's Court of Negombo in case bearing No. 126/22. It is against
that Order, the instant appeal was preferred by the Petitioner.

This Court is mindful of the fact that the Respondent has not paid
maintenance to the Petitioner and his children from 19-06-2020 up to
date. It appears to this Court that the Board of Quazis has not stated the
reasons for the said interim Order. It is settled law that satisfactory
reasons should be given for the judicial and quasi-judicial decisions. A
decision not supported by adequate reasons is liable to be quashed.
Giving reasons for a judicial decision is an important feature in today’s
context, which cannot be lightly disregarded. Moreover, in a situation,
where giving reasons have been ignored, such a Court would run the risk
of having acted arbitrarily in coming to its conclusion.

The Respondent was
in arrears of maintenance in a sum of
Rs. 2,160,000/- at the time of issuing the impugned stay order. In such
a situation, there is a duty cast upon the Board of Quazis to give strong
and cogent reasons to recall the said enforcement certificate, whereas the
Board of Quazi has totally failed to do so. In those circumstances, it is
the considered view of this Court that the impugned stay order is liable
to be quashed on that ground alone. The Board of Quazis has failed to
consider the fact that it is the fundamental duty of the Respondent to
maintain his spouse and children, he has ignored that duty and
contracted another marriage. It is to be noted that the Board of Quazis
has made the impugned Order ex-parte without hearing the Petitioner
and thereby failed to adhere to the principle of audi alteram partem.

It is borne out from the proceedings before the learned Quazi, that the
inquiry was held inter-parte and the Respondent was heard before
making his Order. The Respondent has placed his signature on all
proceedings. The Respondent was present in Court on the day the
maintenance Order was made. Moreover, before issuing the enforcement
certificate, the learned Quazi had issued a show cause notice to the
Respondent, returnable on 15-10-2022. On 15-10-2022, since the
Respondent failed to comply with the Order of the learned Quazi, the
enforcement certificate was issued.
is
abundantly clear that the averment contained in paragraph 11 of the
amended Petition filed before the Board of Quazis stating that the

learned Quazi has made the Order without
Respondent is erroneous. The Respondent has suppressed the material
facts to the Board of Quazis and obtained the impugned stay Order.
Furthermore, as the Respondent had not paid the maintenance to the
Petitioner and his children right throughout, it is the view of this Court
that the Respondent did not come before the Board of Quazis with clean
hands, and therefore, he is not entitled to invoke the revisionary
jurisdiction of the Board of Quazis.
