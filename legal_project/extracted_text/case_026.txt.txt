ORDER 

P.Kumararatnam,J. 

The  Petitioner  is  the  brother  of  the  Suspect  named  in  the  in-B  Report 

filed  in  the  Magistrate  Court  of  Maligakanda  case  bearing  No.  B 

31689/2023.The Petitioner has filed this bail application under Section 

83(2) of the Poisons, Opium and Dangerous Drugs (Amendment) Act No. 

41 of 2022.  

According to the B report filed by the police, the Suspect was arrested on 

07.08.2023  while  on  routine  patrol  duty.  According  to  the  police  the 

Suspect was arrested inside his house with a bag holding at the time of 

his arrest.   Upon search of the bag some contraband found inside reacted 

for  Methamphetamine. 

The 

substance 

suspected 

to 

be 

Methamphetamine weighed about 244 grams.   

The Suspect was produced in the Magistrate Court of Maligakanda under 

Sections  54A  (b)  and  (d)  of  the  Poisons,  Opium  and  Dangerous  Drugs 

Ordinance as amended by Act No. 13 of 1984.    

The Petitioner has pleaded following exceptional circumstances in 

support of her Bail Application.  

1.  Lack of concrete evidence. 

2.  Violation of standard procedure. 

3.  Presumption of innocence. 

4.  Risk of wrongful incarceration. 

5.  No application for detention order. 

6.  Common mode of fabrication. 

7.  Delay in filing proper charges. 

3 | P a g e  

 
 
 
 
 
CA Bail 312-2024 

The Learned State Counsel submitted that the delay is not an exceptional 

circumstance to be considered to enlarge the suspect on bail. Further, 

the  time  spent  for  preparing  the  indictment  does  not  constitute  an 

exceptional circumstance. According to the State, indictment has already 

gone to the High Court of Colombo.  

Exceptional circumstances are not defined in the statute. Hence, what is 

exceptional  circumstances  must  be  considered  on  its  own  facts  and 

circumstances on a case by case. 

In  Ramu  Thamodarampillai  v.  The  Attorney  General  [2004]  3  SLR 

180 the court held that: 

“the decision must in each case depend on its own peculiar facts and 

circumstances”. 

In  CA(PHC)APN  107/2018  decided  on  19.03.2019  the  court  held  that 

remanding for a period of one year and five months without being served 

with the in indictment was considered inter alia in releasing the suspect 

on bail. According to the Petitioner, at present her family is going through 

untold hardship without proper income and care.    

The Section 83 of the Poison, Opium and Dangerous Drugs Act which 

was amended by Act No. 41 of 2022 states: 

 83. (1) Subject to the provisions of sections 84, 85 and subsection (2) of 

this section, a person suspected or accused of an offence under sections 

54A and 54B of this Ordinance, shall not be released on bail by the High 

Court except in exceptional circumstances.  

(2)  Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of  sections  84  and  85,  a  person 

suspected or accused of an offence under subsection (1) of section 54A 

and section 54B- 

(a)  of  which  the  pure  quantity  of  the  dangerous  drug,  trafficked, 

imported, exported, or possessed is ten grammes or above in terms 

4 | P a g e  

 
 
CA Bail 312-2024 

of the report issued by the Government Analyst under section 77A; 

and 

(b) which is punishable with death or life imprisonment, shall not be 

released  on  bail  except  by  the  Court  of  Appeal  in  exceptional 

circumstances.   

shall not be released on bail except by the Court of Appeal in exceptional 

circumstances. 

In  this  case  the  pure  quantity  of  Methamphetamine  detected  in  the 

production by the Government Analyst is 127.5 grams. Hence, this court 

has jurisdiction to consider granting of bail as per the new amendment.  

The Counsel for the Petitioner urged this Court to consider that detaining 

a suspect without any legal action for an extended period of time amounts 

to a violation of his fundamental rights which can be considered as an 

exceptional ground. 

The Suspect has no previous or pending case in any of the Court. 

In Nasher v. Director of Public Prosecution [2020] VSCA 144 the court 

held that: 

“a  combination  of  delay,  onerous  custodial  conditions,  and  the 

relative weakness of the prosecution case may, when considered with 

all  relevant  circumstances,  compel  the  conclusion  that  exceptional 

circumstances have been established”. [Emphasis added] 

The Petitioner states that the Government Analyst Report was received 

on 19.10.2023 and the indictment was sent to the High Court on 09.10. 

2024. Even though the indictment filed in the High Court, it takes long 

time  to  commence  the  trial.  Further  the  Petitioner  contends  that  the 

substances were not recovered from the Suspect.   

Offences  under  Section  54A(b)  and  54A(d)  of  the  Poisons  Opium  and 

Dangerous Drugs Ordinance as amended by the Act No.13 of 1984 is no 

doubt serious offences but seriousness of the offence alone cannot form 

5 | P a g e  

 
 
CA Bail 312-2024 

a ground to refuse bail. In considering these matters, the court must bear 

in mind the presumption of innocence. 

Further, bail should never be withheld as punishment. Granting of bail 

is  primarily  at  the  discretion  of  the  Courts.  The  discretion  should  be 

exercised  with  due care  and  caution  taking  into  account  the  facts  and 

circumstances of each case.   

The indictment was served on the Suspect on 18.03.2025. It was brought 

to  the  notice  of  the  Court  that  the  pre-trial  has  not  commenced.  Even 

though  the  indictment  filed  in  the  High  Court,  it  takes  long  time  to 

commence  the  trial.  The  Suspect  is  in  remand  custody  for  nearly  20 

months. The indictment was served after 17 months of his arrest.  

Considering  all  these  factors  into  account,  especially  the  period  in 

remand,  the  pure  quantity  Methamphetamine  detected  and  the  other 

circumstances of the case, I consider this an appropriate case to grant 

bail  to  the  Suspect.  Hence,  I  order  the  Suspect  be  granted  bail  with 

following strict conditions. 

1.  Cash bail of Rs.200,000/=.  

2.  To provide 02 sureties. They must sign a bond of two million each. 

The Petitioner should be the one of the sureties.  

3.  The Suspect and the sureties must reside in the address given until 

conclusion of his case. 

4.  Not to approach any prosecution witnesses directly or indirectly or 

to interfere with. 

5.  To surrender his passport if any, to court and not to apply for a 

travel document. The Controller of the Immigration and Emigration 

is informed of the travel ban on the Suspect. 

6.  To  report  to  the  Officer-in-Charge,  Police  Station,  Wolfendhal 

Street on the second and last Sunday of every month between 9am 

to 1pm. 

7.  Any breach of these conditions is likely to result in the cancellation 

of his bail.

CA Bail 312-2024 

The Bail is allowed and the Learned Magistrate of Maligakanda is hereby 

directed to enlarge the Suspect on bail on the above bail conditions. 

The Registrar of this Court is directed to send this order to the Magistrate 

Court  of  Maligakanda  and  the  Officer-in-Charge,  Police  Station, 

Wolfendhal Street.  

K.M.S.Dissanayake, J.   

I agree.
