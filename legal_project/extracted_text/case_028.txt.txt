CA Bail 417-2024 

P.Kumararatnam,J. 

The Petitioner is the mother of the Accused named in the High Court of 

Negombo case bearing No. HC 65/2024.   

According  to  the  B  report  filed  by  the  police,  upon  information  the 

Accused was arrested by officers attached to the Police Narcotics Bureau 

Colombo-01  on  24.03.2023.  The  Accused  was  searched  and  some 

substances  believed  to  be  Methamphetamine  was  recovered  from  his 

shorts pocket.   

The parcel was weighed by an electronic scale and it revealed 113 grams 

of Methamphetamine in the parcel.    

The Accused was produced in the Welisara Magistrate Court under case 

No. B 1189/2023 and facts were reported under Sections 54A(d) and (b) 

of the Poisons, Opium and Dangerous Drugs Ordinance as amended by 

Act No. 13 of 1984.  

According  to  the  Petitioner,  he  has  been  in  remand  for  more  than  two 

years  to  date.  According  to  the  Government  Analyst  Report,  the  pure 

quantity of Methamphetamine is 75.6 grams. 

The Petitioner has pleaded following exceptional circumstances in 

support of this Bail Application.  

1.  The Government Analyst Report was received 1 year and 1 month 

ago and no indictment has been forwarded yet.  

2.  He is in remand tittle more than two years to date. 

3.  The police have fabricated a case against him. 

4.  The Accused had denied possession of any illegal substances. 

5.  The Accused is the sole breadwinner of the family.  

Exceptional circumstances are not defined in the statute. Hence, what is 

exceptional  circumstances  must  be  considered  on  its  own  facts  and 

circumstances on a case by case.

CA Bail 417-2024 

In  Ramu  Thamodarampillai  v.  The  Attorney  General  [2004]  3  SLR 

180 the court held that: 

“the decision must in each case depend on its own peculiar facts and 

circumstances”. 

The Section 83 of the Poison, Opium and Dangerous Drugs Act which 

was amended by Act No. 41 of 2022 states: 

 83. (1) Subject to the provisions of sections 84, 85 and subsection (2) of 

this section, a person suspected or accused of an offence under sections 

54A and 54B of this Ordinance, shall not be released on bail by the High 

Court except in exceptional circumstances.  

(2)  Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of  sections  84  and  85,  a  person 

suspected or accused of an offence under subsection (1) of section 54A 

and section 54B- 

(a)  of  which  the  pure  quantity  of  the  dangerous  drug,  trafficked, 

imported, exported, or possessed is ten grammes or above in terms 

of the report issued by the Government Analyst under section 77A; 

and 

(b) which is punishable with death or life imprisonment,   

shall not be released on bail except by the Court of Appeal in exceptional 

circumstances. 

In  this  case,  the  pure  quantity  of  Methamphetamine  detected  in  the 

production by the Government Analyst is 75.6 grams. Hence, this court 

has jurisdiction to consider granting of bail as per the new amendment. 

In  this  case,  as  per  the  submission  of  the  Learned  State  Counsel,  the 

indictment had already been dispatched to the High Court of Negombo 

and  the  pre-trial  is  concluded.  Now  the  case  is  fixed  for  trial  on 

06.02.2025.

CA Bail 417-2024 

Further, the Learned State Counsel brought to the notice of this Court 

that the Petitioner has not come before this Court with clean hand as she 

wilfully omitted to mention in the Petition about the previous conviction 

and  the  pending  case  reported  against  the  Accused.  The  Accused  was 

arrested  by  Harbour  Police  for  possession  of  960  milligrams  of 

Methamphetamine  on  09.12.2021.  Further,  the  Special  Task  Force 

officers had arrested the Accused for the possession of 42.605 kilograms 

of  cannabis  and  the  matter  is  pending  before  the  Magistrate  Court  of 

Welisara.  Both  cases  are  connected  to  possession  of  narcotics 

substances. 

The  Offence  under  Section  54A(d)  and  (b)  of  the  Poisons  Opium  and 

Dangerous Drugs Ordinance as amended by the Act No.13 of 1984 is a 

serious offence and the seriousness of the offence should be considered 

when bail is considered.  

In  Ranil  Charuka  Kulatunga  v.  Attorney  General  CA  (PHC)  APN 

134/2015 the court held that: 

“The quantity of cocaine involved in this case is 62.847 grams, 

which is a commercial quantity. If Petitioner is convicted, the 

punishment  is  death  or  life  imprisonment.  Under  these 

circumstances, it is prudent to conclude the trial early while 

the Petitioner is kept in custody.” 

In this case the pure Methamphetamine detected is 75.6 grams, which 

certainly a commercial quantity.   

Considering the seriousness of the sentence prescribed under the Poison, 

Opium  and  Dangerous  Drugs  Ordinance  it  is  prudent  to  conclude  the 

High Court case expeditiously keeping the Accused in remand.   

Hence, I do not consider the delay more than 2 years in remand falls into 

the  category  of  excessive  and  oppressive  delay  considering  the 

circumstances of this case. 

5 | P a g e  

 
 
 
CA Bail 417-2024 

Considering all these factors into account, especially the pure quantity 

of Methamphetamine detected, the charges in the indictment against the 

Accused,  drug  related  previous  and  pending  cases  and  other 

circumstances of the case, I consider this is not an appropriate case to 

sanction bail to the Accused at this stage. Hence, I refuse to release the 

Accused on bail. 

Hence, this Bail Application is dismissed. 

The Registrar of this Court is directed to send this order to the High Court 

of  Negombo  and  Officer-in-Charge  of  the  Police  Narcotics  Bureau, 

Colombo-01. 

K.M.S.Dissanayake, J.   

I agree.
