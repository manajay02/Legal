ORDER 

P.Kumararatnam,J. 

The  Petitioner  had  applied  for  bail  on  behalf  of  the  Suspect  under 

Section  83(2)  of  the  Poisons,  Opium  and  Dangerous  Drugs  Ordinance 

amended  Act  No.41  of  2022.  The  Petitioner  is  the  husband  of  the 

Suspect. 

On  17.02.2022,  upon  receiving  an  information,  the  Suspect  was 

arrested by officers attached to Peliyagoda Police Station and recovered 

a  parcel  from  the  Suspect.  The  parcel  was  recovered  from  his  pair  of 

shorts  pocket.  The  parcels  contained  some  substances  which  reacted 

for  Heroin  (Diacetylmorphine).  The  substance  weighed  about  101 

grams. 

The  Suspect  was  produced  and  facts  were  reported  to  the  Colombo 

Magistrate  under  Section  54A  (b)  and  (d)  of  the  Poisons,  Opium  and 

Dangerous  Drugs  Ordinance  as  amended  by  the  Act  No.13  of  1984.  A

detention  order  was  obtained  to  conduct  further  investigation  in 

keeping the Suspect under police custody.  

The  production  had  been  sent  to  the  Government  Analyst  Department 

on 20/02/2023. After analysis, the Government Analyst had forwarded 

the  report  to  Court  on  23/07/2023.  According  to  the  Government 

Analyst,  16.32  grams  of  pure  Heroin  (Diacetylmorphine)  had  been 

detected from the substance sent for the analysis. 

The  Following  exceptional  circumstances  are  submitted  by  the 

Petitioner:  

1.  The suspect is in remand custody nearly for about 27 months. 

2.  No suspicious substance recovered from the  Suspect  at the  time 

of his arrest. 

3.  The Suspect is a father of two children and the sole breadwinner 

of the family. 

4.  No indictment filed in Court up to now. 

One  of  the  preliminary  objections  taken  up  by  the  State  is  that  the 

Petitioner  has 

failed 

to  establish  an  acceptable 

“exceptional 

circumstance” to invoke the jurisdiction of this Court.       

The  Learned  State  Counsel  submitted  that  the  delay  is  not  an 

exceptional  circumstance  to  be  considered  to  enlarge  the  Accused  on 

bail.  Further,  the  time  spent  for  preparing  the  indictment  does  not 

constitute an exceptional circumstance. Although a file is opened under 

AG reference No. CR3/157/25, indictment has not gone out yet.  

The suspect is in remand for nearly 27 months.  

Exceptional circumstances are not defined in the statute. Hence, what 

is  exceptional  circumstances  must  be  considered  on  its  own  facts  and 

circumstances on a case by case. 

In  Ramu  Thamodarampillai  v.  The  Attorney  General  [2004]  3  SLR 

180 the court held that: 

3 | P a g e  

 
 
CA Bail 445/2024 

“the decision must in each case depend on its own peculiar facts and 

circumstances”.    

The  Section  83  of  the  Poison,  Opium  and  Dangerous  Drugs  Act 

which was amended by Act No. 41 of 2022 states: 

 83. (1) Subject to the provisions of sections 84, 85 and subsection (2) of 

this  section,  a  person  suspected  or  accused  of  an  offence  under 

sections  54A  and  54B  of  this  Ordinance,  shall  not  be  released  on  bail 

by the High Court except in exceptional circumstances.  

(2)  Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of  sections  84  and  85,  a  person 

suspected or accused of an offence under subsection (1) of section 54A 

and section 54B- 

(a)  of  which  the  pure  quantity  of  the  dangerous  drug,  trafficked, 

imported, exported, or possessed is ten grammes or above in terms 

of the report issued by the Government Analyst under section 77A; 

and 

(b) which is punishable with death or life imprisonment,  

shall  not  be  released  on  bail  except  by  the  Court  of  Appeal  in 

exceptional circumstances. 

In  this  case  the  pure  quantity  of  Heroin  detected  in  the  production  by 

the  Government  Analyst  is  16.32  grams.  Hence,  this  Court  has 

jurisdiction to consider granting of bail as per the new amendment.  

The learned Counsel for the Petitioner urged this Court to consider that 

the  detaining  a  Suspect  for  an  extended  period  of  time  amounts  to  a 

violation  of  his  fundamental  rights  which  can  be  considered  as  an 

exceptional ground. 

The Learned Counsel for the Petitioner submitted that the Suspect was 

not in possession any contraband when he was arrested. 

4 | P a g e  

 
 
CA Bail 445/2024 

The  factual  and  evidentiary  matters  pertain  to  the  investigations  can 

only be tested at the trial upon the witnesses being cross examined and 

shall  not  be  tested  at  the  time  of  hearing  this  bail  application 

considering the nature of this case. 

In  Nasher  v.  Director  of  Public  Prosecution  [2020]  VSCA  144  the 

court held that: 

“a  combination  of  delay,  onerous  custodial  conditions,  and  the 

relative  weakness  of  the  prosecution  case  may,  when  considered 

with  all  relevant  circumstances,  compel 

the  conclusion 

that 

exceptional circumstances have been established”. 

Accordingly,  considering  the  fact  that  there  has  been  a  delay  of  27 

months  since  in  the  remand  custody,  it  falls  into  the  category  of 

excessive  and  oppressive  delay  taking  into  account  the  circumstances 

of this case.    

The  Offences  under  Section  54A(b)  and  (d)  of  the  Poisons,  Opium  and 

Dangerous Drugs Ordinance as amended by the Act No.13 of 1984 are 

no doubt serious offences but seriousness of the offences alone cannot 

form  a  ground  to  refuse  bail.  In  considering  these  matters,  the  court 

must bear in mind the presumption of innocence.  

Three  previous  convictions  are  reported  against  the  Suspect.  Two  are 

for  possession  of  meagre  amount  of  Cannabis  Sativa  L  and  one 

possession of some milligrams of Heroin. The quantity is not mentioned 

in the report filed by the police. For this the Suspect was ordered to do 

100 hours community service.  

Taking  all  these  into  account,  especially  the  pure  quantity  of  Heroin 

detected,  the  period  in  remand,  delay  in  finalizing  charges  and  other 

circumstances of the case, I consider this an appropriate case to grant 

bail  to  the  Suspect.  Hence,  I  order  the  Suspect  be  granted  bail  with 

following strict conditions. 

1.  Cash bail of Rs.100,000/=.  

5 | P a g e  

 
 
CA Bail 445/2024 

2.  To  provide  02  sureties.  They  must  sign  a  bond  of  two  million 

each. 

3.  The  Suspect  and  the  sureties  must  reside  in  the  address  given 

until conclusion of his case. 

4.  Not  to  approach  any  prosecution  witnesses  directly  or  indirectly 

or to interfere with. 

5.  To surrender his passport if any, to court and not to apply for a 

travel  document.  The  Controller  of  the 

Immigration  and 

Emigration is informed of the travel ban on the Suspect. 

6.  To report to  the Peliyagoda Police Station  on the  second and the 

last Sunday of every month between 9am to 1pm. 

7.  Any  breach  of  these  conditions  is  likely  to  result  in  the 

cancellation of his bail. 

The  Bail  Application  is  allowed  and  the learned  Magistrate  of  Colombo 

is  hereby  directed  to  enlarge  the  Suspect  on  bail  on  the  above  bail 

conditions. 

The  Registrar  of  this  Court  is  directed  to  send  this  Bail  Order  to  the 

Magistrate  Court  of  Colombo  and  Officer-in-Charge  of  the  Head 

Quarters Police Station, Peliyagoda. 

K.M.S. Dissanayake, J.   

I agree.
