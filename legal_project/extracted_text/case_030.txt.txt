ORDER 

The  Petitioner  is  the  mother  of  the  Suspect  in  the  Maligakanda 

Magistrate Court Case No. B 29228/2023. 

On  21.07.2023,  the  Suspect  was  arrested  at  Aaduruppu  Veediya  by 

officers  attached  to  the  Aaduruppu  Veediya  Police  upon  an  allegation 

relating 

to  possession  of  gross  quantity  of  502  grams  of 

Methamphetamine  and  possession  of  gross  quantity  of  34  grams  of 

Heroin.

CA Bail 211-2024 

The suspect was produced and facts were reported to the Maligakanda 

Magistrate  under  Section  54A  (b)  and  (d)  of  the  Poisons,  Opium  and 

Dangerous Drugs Ordinance as amended by the Act No.13 of 1984 and 

a detention order was obtained for further investigations under Section 

82(3) of the said Act. 

The  production  had  been  sent  to  the  Government  Analyst  Department 

on 24/07/2023. After analysis, the Government Analyst had forwarded 

the  report  to  the  Maligakanda  Magistrate  Court.  According  to  the 

Government Analyst, 265.6 grams of pure Methamphetamine and 2.53 

grams  of  pure  Heroin  (Diacetylmorphine)  had  been  detected  from  the 

substance sent for the analysis. 

The Petitioner has pleaded following exceptional circumstances in 

support of the Bail Application.  

1.  The  Petitioner  is  living  with  the  Suspect  as  the  father  of  the 

Suspect was passed away. 

2.  The Suspect is the sole breadwinner of the family. 

3.  The drugs are introduced to the Suspect by the police. 

4.  Complaints  had  been  lodged  at  the  Human  Rights  Commission 

and the Police Commission.  

The  learned  State  Counsel  submitted  that  the  delay  is  not  an 

exceptional  circumstance  to  be  considered  to  enlarge  the  suspect  on 

bail.  Further,  the  time  spent  for  preparing  the  indictment  does  not 

constitute an exceptional circumstance.  

The suspect is in remand for about 21 months as at today.  

Exceptional circumstances are not defined in the statute. Hence, what 

is  exceptional  circumstances  must  be  considered  on  its  own  facts  and 

circumstances on a case by case.

CA Bail 211-2024 

In  Ramu  Thamodarampillai  v.  The  Attorney  General  [2004]  3  SLR 

180 the court held that: 

“the decision must in each case depend on its own peculiar facts and 

circumstances”.  

The  Section  83  of  the  Poison,  Opium  and  Dangerous  Drugs  Act 

which was amended by Act No. 41 of 2022 states: 

 83. (1) Subject to the provisions of sections 84, 85 and subsection (2) of 

this  section,  a  person  suspected  or  accused  of  an  offence  under 

sections  54A  and  54B  of  this  Ordinance,  shall  not  be  released  on  bail 

by the High Court except in exceptional circumstances.  

(2)  Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of  sections  84  and  85,  a  person 

suspected or accused of an offence under subsection (1) of section 54A 

and section 54B- 

(a)  of  which  the  pure  quantity  of  the  dangerous  drug,  trafficked, 

imported, exported, or possessed is ten grammes or above in terms 

of the report issued by the Government Analyst under section 77A; 

and 

(b) which is punishable with death or life imprisonment,  

shall  not  be  released  on  bail  except  by  the  Court  of  Appeal  in 

exceptional circumstances. 

In  this  case,  the  pure  quantity  of  Methamphetamine  detected  in  the 

production  by  the  Government  Analyst  is  265.6  grams.  Hence,  this 

court  has  jurisdiction  to  consider  granting  of  bail  as  per  the  new 

amendment. 

In  this  case,  as  per  the  submission  of  the  Learned  State  Counsel,  the 

dossier of investigations has been received by the Attorney General and 

is under consideration under AG reference No. CR3/377/2024. 

4 | P a g e  

 
 
 
CA Bail 211-2024 

I agree with the learned State Counsel that the factual and evidentiary 

matters pertain to the investigations can only be tested at the trial upon 

the witnesses being cross examined and shall not be tested at the time 

of hearing this bail application considering the nature of this case. 

In  the  Petition,  the  Petitioner  had  disclosed  two  previous  convictions 

entered  in  the  High  Court  of  Kalutara  and  Colombo.  Further  she  had 

disclosed  one  pending  case  before  the  Maligakanda  Magistrate  Court. 

The nature of those cases had not been disclosed by the Petitioner. 

In  addition  to  above,  learned  State  Counsel  in  the  objections  had 

disclosed  three  more  previous  convictions  and  all  are  connected  to 

possession  of  narcotics.  Hence,  I  do  not  consider  the  delay  about  21 

months  in  remand  falls  into  the  category  of  excessive  and  oppressive 

delay considering the circumstances of this case. 

The  Offence  under  Section  54A(b)  and  (d)  of  the  Poisons  Opium  and 

Dangerous Drugs Ordinance as amended by the Act No.13 of 1984 is a 

serious offence and the seriousness of the offence should be considered 

when bail is considered.  

In  Ranil  Charuka  Kulatunga  v.  Attorney  General  CA  (PHC)  APN 

134/2015 the court held that: 

“The  quantity  of  cocaine  involved  in  this  case  is  62.847 

grams,  which  is  a  commercial  quantity.  If  Petitioner  is 

convicted,  the  punishment  is  death  or  life  imprisonment. 

Under these circumstances, it is prudent to conclude the trial 

early while the Petitioner is kept in custody.” 

In this case the pure Methamphetamine detected is 265.6 grams, which 

certainly a very high commercial quantity. Considering the seriousness 

of  the  sentence  prescribed  under  the  Poison,  Opium  and  Dangerous 

Drugs Ordinance, there is a high risk of absconding.   

5 | P a g e  

 
 
 
CA Bail 211-2024 

Considering all these factors into account, especially the pure quantity 

of  Methamphetamine  detected,  previous  and  pending  cases  reported 

against the Suspect and other circumstances of the case, I consider this 

is not the appropriate time to grant bail to the Suspect. 

Hence, this bail application is dismissed. 

The  Registrar  of  this  Court  is  directed  to  send  this  Order  to  the 

Magistrate  Court  of  Maligakanda  and  Officer-in-Charge  of  the 

Aaduruppu Veediya Police Station. 

K.M.G.H.Kulatunga, J.   

I agree.
