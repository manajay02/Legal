ORDER 

P.Kumararatnam,J. 

The  Petitioner  is  the  mother  of  the  Accused.  The  Accused  has  been 

named in M.C. Gampola Case No. B 182/2021. She had applied for bail 

for her son. 

On  24.02.2021,  the  Accused  was  arrested  by  the  Officers  attached  to 

the Gampola Police Station upon an allegation relating to possession of 

50.765 grams of substance suspected to be Heroin. According to police 

the contraband was seized from his undergarment. 

The  Accused  was  produced  and  facts  were  reported  to  the  Gampola 

Magistrate  under  Section  54A  (d)  and  (b)  of  the  Poisons,  Opium  and 

Dangerous Drugs Ordinance as amended by the Act No.13 of 1984. 

The  production  had  been  sent  to  the  Government  Analyst  Department 

on 03/08/2021. After analysis, the Government Analyst had forwarded 

the  report  to  Court  on  15/11/2024.  According  to  the  Government 

Analyst,  21.24  grams  of  pure  Heroin  (Diacetylmorphine)  had  been 

detected from the substance sent for the analysis.   

According  the  Petitioner,  the  Accused  was  arrested  without  any 

contraband in his possession. Having introduced Heroin to him, he had 

been produced before the Magistrate Court of Gampola on 24.02.2021.

CA Bail 240-2024 

The Petitioner has pleaded following exceptional circumstances in 

support of this Bail Application.  

1.  No  drugs  were  found  in  his  possession  of  the  Accused  and  the 

drugs is introduced by the police officers to him. 

2.  The Accused had been in remand well over 04 years. 

3.  The Accused is the sole breadwinner of the family. 

4.  The Accused has child aged two years. 

5.  No previous or pending case reported.  

6.  The Petitioner has a serious medical condition. 

The Learned State  Counsel opposing for bail,  submitted that the delay 

is  not  an  exceptional  circumstance  to  be  considered  to  enlarge  the 

Accused  on  bail.  Further,  the  time  spent  for  preparing  the  indictment 

does  not  constitute  an  exceptional  circumstance.  The  indictment  has 

already filed in the High Court of Kandy.     

The  Accused  is  in  remand  well  over  four  years.  According  to  the 

Government Analyst Report, the pure quantity of Heroin detected from 

the possession of Accused is 21.24 grams.  

Exceptional circumstances are not defined in the statute. Hence, what 

is  exceptional  circumstances  must  be  considered  on  its  own  facts  and 

circumstances on a case by case. 

In  Ramu  Thamodarampillai  v.  The  Attorney  General  [2004]  3  SLR 

180 the court held that: 

“the decision must in each case depend on its own peculiar facts and 

circumstances”.

CA Bail 240-2024 

The  Section  83  of  the  Poison,  Opium  and  Dangerous  Drugs  Act 

which was amended by Act No. 41 of 2022 states: 

 83. (1) Subject to the provisions of sections 84, 85 and subsection (2) of 

this  section,  a  person  suspected  or  accused  of  an  offence  under 

sections  54A  and  54B  of  this  Ordinance,  shall  not  be  released  on  bail 

by the High Court except in exceptional circumstances.  

(2)  Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of  sections  84  and  85,  a  person 

suspected or accused of an offence under subsection (1) of section 54A 

and section 54B- 

(a)  of  which  the  pure  quantity  of  the  dangerous  drug,  trafficked, 

imported, exported, or possessed is ten grammes or above in terms 

of the report issued by the Government Analyst under section 77A; 

and 

(b) which is punishable with death or life imprisonment,  

shall  not  be  released  on  bail  except  by  the  Court  of  Appeal  in 

exceptional circumstances. 

In this case, the pure quantity of  heroin detected in the production by 

the  Government  Analyst  is  21.24  grams.  Hence,  this  court  has 

jurisdiction to consider granting of bail as per the new amendment. 

The Counsel for the Petitioner submitted that the police have fabricated 

a case against the Accused.       

I agree with the learned State Counsel that the factual and evidentiary 

matters pertain to the investigations can only be tested at the trial upon 

the witnesses being cross examined and shall not be tested at the time 

of hearing this bail application considering the nature of this case. 

In  this  case  the  probability  of  the  happening  of  the  incident  as 

described by the police need to be assessed thoroughly before the court 

5 | P a g e  

 
 
 
CA Bail 240-2024 

could come to a final decision. This could only be done at a trial. Until 

such  time  keeping  the  Accused  in  remand,  I  consider  is  not  proper 

under the circumstances of this matter.    

Hence, I consider the delay well over 04 years in remand falls into the 

category  of  excessive  and  oppressive  delay  considering 

the 

circumstances of this case. 

Offences  under  Section  54A(d)  and  54A(b)  of  the  Poisons  Opium  and 

Dangerous Drugs Ordinance as amended by the Act No.13 of 1984 is no 

doubt serious offences but seriousness of the offence alone cannot form 

a  ground  to  refuse  bail.  In  considering  these  matters,  the  court  must 

bear in mind the presumption of innocence. 

Further, bail should never be withheld as punishment. Granting of bail 

is  primarily  at  the  discretion  of  the  Courts.  The  discretion  should  be 

exercised  with  due care  and  caution  taking  into  account  the  facts  and 

circumstances of each case.    

Considering  all  these  factors  into  account,  especially  the  period  in 

remand, the circumstances of arrest and the other circumstances of the 

case,  I  consider  this  an  appropriate  case  to  grant  bail  to  the  Accused. 

Hence,  I  order  the  Accused  be  granted  bail  with  following  strict 

conditions. 

1.  Cash bail of Rs.100,000/=.  

2.  To  provide  02  sureties.  They  must  sign  a  bond  of  two  million 

each. The Portioner should be one of the sureties. 

3.  The  Accused  and  the  sureties  must  reside  in  the  address  given 

until conclusion of her case. 

4.  Not  to  approach  any  prosecution  witnesses  directly  or  indirectly 

or to interfere with. 

5.  To surrender his passport if any, to court and not to apply for a 

travel  document.  The  Controller  of  the 

Immigration  and 

Emigration is informed of the travel ban on the Accused. 

6 | P a g e  

 
 
CA Bail 240-2024 

6.  To report to the Gampola Police Station (Anti-Corruption Division) 

on the last Sunday of every month between 9am to 1pm. 

7.  Any  breach  of  these  conditions  is  likely  to  result  in  the 

cancellation of his bail. 

The  Bail  is  allowed  and  the  Learned  High  Court  Judge  is  hereby 

directed to enlarge the Accused on bail on the above bail conditions. 

The Registrar of this Court is directed to send this bail order to the High 

Court of Kandy and Officer-in-Charge of the Police Station, Gampola. 

K.M.S,Dissanayake J.   

I agree.
