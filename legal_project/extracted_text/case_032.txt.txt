CA Bail 328-2024 

On 29.02.2022, the Suspect was arrested on a tip off received from an 

officer attached to the Police Narcotics Bureau.  The Suspect was arrested 

along with a car bearing No.WP CBB 3881. When the police team waylaid 

upon  the  information  had  seen  the  Suspect  who  came  in  the  car 

mentioned above and got down with a tulip bag to be given to somebody. 

Upon establishing his identity through the informant, the Suspect was 

arrested and recovered the bag. Two parcels were in the bag recovered 

from the Suspect. The police had noticed some substance in both parcels. 

The  substance  in  the  first  parcel  was  reacted  for  Heroin  and  the 

substance  in  the  2nd  parcel  reacted  for  Methamphetamine.  The  gross 

quantity  of  Heroin  was  weighed  about  101.170  grams  and  the  gross 

quantity of Methamphetamine weighed about 100.100 grams. 

The  car  was  searched  thereafter  and  the  salutes  had  found  cash 

Rs.2481250/- in a tulip bag. The Suspect was arrested for trafficking and 

possession  of  Heroin  (Diacetylmorphine)  and  Methamphetamine.  A 

separate  investigation  is  being  carried  out  under  the  Anti  Money 

Laundering Act against the Suspect.    

The Suspect was produced and facts were reported to the Maligakanda 

Magistrate  under  Section  54A  (b)  and  (d)  of  the  Poisons,  Opium  and 

Dangerous  Drugs  Ordinance  as  amended  by  the  Act  No.13  of  1984.  A 

detention order was obtained to conduct further investigation. 

The production had been sent to the Government Analyst Department on 

02/08/2022. After analysis, the Government Analyst had forwarded the 

report to Court on 30/01/2022. According to the Government Analyst, 

50.38  grams  of  Methamphetamine  (Net)  and  39.44  grams  of  Heroin 

(Net)had been detected from the substance sent for the analysis.   

According  to  the  Petitioner,  the  Suspect  was  arrested  without  any 

contraband in his possession. He was arrested solely for the purpose of 

keep him in remand custody from a lengthy period of time. The Petitioner

CA Bail 328-2024 

seeks permission of  this  Court to submit tower report  of the Suspect’s 

mobile phone once it is available. 

Consequent  to  further  investigation,  another  person  was  arrested  and 

produced as 2nd Suspect. He was discharged upon the instructions of the 

Hon. Attorney General.    

The Petitioner has pleaded following exceptional circumstances in 

support of this Bail Application.   

1.  Despite  22  months  have  gone  since  the  issuance  of  the 

Government Analyst Report, the trial against the Suspect has not 

even started. 

2.  It will take an indefinite period to have an acquittal or conviction, 

even if the Suspect is indicted. 

3.  Elder  son  of  the  Suspect  is  to  face  the  Grade  5  Scholarship 

examination. 

4.  The  telephone  tower  report  of  the  Suspect  phone  number  will 

reveal the untruthfulness of the police version. 

5.  Suspicion on the inward journey.   

The Learned State Counsel opposing for bail, submitted that the delay is 

not an exceptional circumstance to be considered to enlarge the suspect 

on  bail.  Further,  the  time  spent  for  preparing  the  indictment  does  not 

constitute  an  exceptional  circumstance.  At  present  indictment  against 

the Suspect has been filed in the High Court of Colombo under case no. 

HC 4940/2024. Upon conclusion of the pre-trial, the case was fixed for 

trial on 20.03.2025. 

The suspect is in remand nearly two years and 08 months. According to 

the Government Analyst Report, the pure quantity of Methamphetamine 

detected  from  the  possession  of  Suspect  is  50.38  grams  and  the  pure 

quantity of Heroin is 39.44 grams.

CA Bail 328-2024 

Exceptional circumstances are not defined in the statute. Hence, what is 

exceptional  circumstances  must  be  considered  on  its  own  facts  and 

circumstances on a case by case. 

In  Ramu  Thamodarampillai  v.  The  Attorney  General  [2004]  3  SLR 

180 the court held that: 

“the decision must in each case depend on its own peculiar facts and 

circumstances”.    

The Section 83 of the Poison, Opium and Dangerous Drugs Act which 

was amended by Act No. 41 of 2022 states: 

 83. (1) Subject to the provisions of sections 84, 85 and subsection (2) of 

this section, a person suspected or accused of an offence under sections 

54A and 54B of this Ordinance, shall not be released on bail by the High 

Court except in exceptional circumstances.  

(2)  Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of  sections  84  and  85,  a  person 

suspected or accused of an offence under subsection (1) of section 54A 

and section 54B- 

(a)  of  which  the  pure  quantity  of  the  dangerous  drug,  trafficked, 

imported, exported, or possessed is ten grammes or above in terms 

of the report issued by the Government Analyst under section 77A; 

and 

(b) which is punishable with death or life imprisonment,  

shall not be released on bail except by the Court of Appeal in exceptional 

circumstances. 

In  this  case,  the  pure  quantity  of  Methamphetamine  detected  in  the 

production  by  the  Government  Analyst  is  50.38  grams  and  the  pure 

5 | P a g e  

 
 
 
 
CA Bail 328-2024 

quantity  of  Heroin  detected  is  39.44  grams.  Hence,  this  court  has 

jurisdiction to consider granting of bail as per the new amendment. 

The Counsel for the Petitioner submitted that the police have fabricated 

a  case  against  the  Suspect.  The  2nd  Suspect  was  discharged  upon  the 

instructions of the Hon. Attorney General.     

I agree with the learned State Counsel that the factual and evidentiary 

matters pertain to the investigations can only be tested at the trial upon 

the witnesses being cross examined and shall not be tested at the time of 

hearing this bail application considering the nature of this case. 

Further, I do not consider the delay nearly two years and 08 months in 

remand  falls  into  the  category  of  excessive  and  oppressive  delay 

considering the circumstances of this case. Further, family situation of 

the Suspect cannot be considered as an exceptional circumstance, as it 

is the normal day to day life of the people. 

The learned State Counsel submits that the indictment is already filed in 

the High Court of Colombo.   

The  Offence  under  Section  54A  (b)  and  (d)  of  the  Poisons  Opium  and 

Dangerous Drugs Ordinance as amended by the Act No.13 of 1984 is a 

serious offence and the seriousness of the offence should be considered 

when bail is considered.  

In this case the pure Methamphetamine detected is 50.38 grams which 

certainly a commercial quantity. Additionally net quantity of 39.44 grams 

of  Heroin  too  had  been  detected.  Considering  the  seriousness  of  the 

sentence  prescribed  under  the  Poison,  Opium  and  Dangerous  Drugs 

Ordinance, there is a high risk of absconding.    

Considering all these factors into account, especially the pure quantity 

of Methamphetamine and Heroin  detected, and  other  circumstances of 

the case, I consider this is not an appropriate case to grant bail to the 

Suspect at this stage.

Hence, the bail application is hereby dismissed. 

The Registrar of this Court is directed to send this order to the High Court 

of  Colombo  under  case  no.  4940/2024,  the  Magistrate  Court  of 

Maligakanda,  and  the  Officer-in-Charge,  Police  Narcotics  Bureau, 

Colombo-01. 

K.M.S, Dissanayake J.   

I agree.
