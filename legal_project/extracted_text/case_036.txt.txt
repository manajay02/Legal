CA Bail 385-2024 

On  08.12.2023,  the  Suspect  was  arrested  at  Mahawatta  by  the  police 

officers attached to Mawanella Police Station upon an allegation relating 

to possession of 33.960 grams of Methamphetamine (ICE). 

The  suspect  was  produced  and  facts  were  reported  to  the  Mawanella 

Magistrate  under  Section  54A  (d)  and  (b)  of  the  Poisons,  Opium  and 

Dangerous Drugs Ordinance as amended by the Act No.13 of 1984. 

The  production  had  been  sent  to  the  Government  Analyst  Department 

on 06/02/2024. After analysis, the Government Analyst had forwarded 

the  report  to  Court  on  26/08/2024.  According  to  the  Government 

Analyst, 24.8 grams of pure Methamphetamine (ICE) had been detected 

from the substance sent for the analysis.   

According  the  Petitioner,  the  Suspect  was  arrested  without  any 

contraband in his possession. Having introduced Methamphetamine to 

him,  he  had  been  produced  before  the  Magistrate  Court  of  Mahara  on 

18.12.2023. 

The Petitioner has pleaded following exceptional circumstances in 

support of her Bail Application.  

1.  No  drugs  were  found  in  his  possession  of  the  Suspect  and  the 

drugs is introduced by the police officers to him. 

2.  The Suspect had been in remand over 15 months. 

3.  The Suspect is the sole breadwinner of the family. 

4.  The Suspect has a 03-year-old daughter.  

The Learned State  Counsel opposing for bail,  submitted that the delay 

is  not  an  exceptional  circumstance  to  be  considered  to  enlarge  the 

suspect  on  bail.  Further,  the  time  spent  for  preparing  the  indictment 

does  not  constitute  an  exceptional  circumstance.  The  learned  State 

Counsel further submits that the Suspect had 02 previous convictions 

and has one pending case and all are related to drugs.

CA Bail 385-2024 

The  suspect  is  in  remand  for  more  than  15  months.  According  to  the 

Government  Analyst  Report,  the  pure  quantity  of  Methamphetamine 

detected from the possession of Suspect is 24.8 grams.  

Exceptional circumstances are not defined in the statute. Hence, what 

is  exceptional  circumstances  must  be  considered  on  its  own  facts  and 

circumstances on a case by case. 

In  Ramu  Thamodarampillai  v.  The  Attorney  General  [2004]  3  SLR 

180 the court held that: 

“the decision must in each case depend on its own peculiar facts and 

circumstances”.    

The  Section  83  of  the  Poison,  Opium  and  Dangerous  Drugs  Act 

which was amended by Act No. 41 of 2022 states: 

 83. (1) Subject to the provisions of sections 84, 85 and subsection (2) of 

this  section,  a  person  suspected  or  accused  of  an  offence  under 

sections  54A  and  54B  of  this  Ordinance,  shall  not  be  released  on  bail 

by the High Court except in exceptional circumstances.  

(2)  Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of  sections  84  and  85,  a  person 

suspected or accused of an offence under subsection (1) of section 54A 

and section 54B- 

(a)  of  which  the  pure  quantity  of  the  dangerous  drug,  trafficked, 

imported, exported, or possessed is ten grammes or above in terms 

of the report issued by the Government Analyst under section 77A; 

and 

(b) which is punishable with death or life imprisonment,  

shall  not  be  released  on  bail  except  by  the  Court  of  Appeal  in 

exceptional circumstances.

CA Bail 385-2024 

In  this  case,  the  pure  quantity  of  Methamphetamine  detected  in  the 

production by the Government Analyst is 24.8 grams. Hence, this court 

has jurisdiction to consider granting of bail as per the new amendment. 

The  production  was  sent  to  the  Government  Analyst  Department  on 

06.02.2024  and  the  report  was  received  by  the  Magistrate  Court  of 

Mahara  on  26.08.2024.  Although  07  months  have  passed  the 

prosecution is unable to send out indictment to the High Court. 

The Counsel for the Petitioner submitted that the police have fabricated 

a case against the Suspect.       

I agree with the learned State Counsel that the factual and evidentiary 

matters pertain to the investigations can only be tested at the trial upon 

the witnesses being cross examined and shall not be tested at the time 

of hearing this bail application considering the nature of this case. 

The Petitioner has not disclosed the previous or pending case/s against 

the  Suspect.  The  learned  State  Counsel  in  his  submissions  submitted 

to  this  Court  that  the  Suspect  has  two  previous  convictions  and  a 

pending  case  and  all  are  related  to  possession  of  drugs.  This  clearly 

shows his propensity towards committing drug related offences.   

Further,  I  do  not  consider  the  delay  more  than  15  months  in  remand 

falls into the category of excessive and oppressive delay considering the 

circumstances of this case. 

The  Offence  under  Section  54A  (d)  and  (b)  of  the  Poisons  Opium  and 

Dangerous Drugs Ordinance as amended by the Act No.13 of 1984 is a 

serious offence and the seriousness of the offence should be considered 

when bail is considered.  

In  this  case  the  Methamphetamine  detected  is  24.8  grams,  which 

certainly  a  commercial  quantity.  Considering  the  seriousness  of  the 

sentence  prescribed  under  the  Poison,  Opium  and  Dangerous  Drugs 

Ordinance,  there  is  a  high  risk  of  absconding.  Hence,  it  is  prudent  to 

5 | P a g e  

 
 
CA Bail 385-2024 

indict  and  conclude  the  High  Court  case  expeditiously  keeping  the 

Suspect in remand.     

Considering all these factors into account, especially the pure quantity 

of  Methamphetamine  detected,  the  previous  convictions  and  pending 

case  related  to  drug  offences  and  other  circumstances  of  the  case,  I 

consider  this  not  an  appropriate  case  to  grant  bail  to  the  Suspect  at 

this stage. 

Hence, the bail application is hereby dismissed. 

The  Registrar  of  this  Court  is  directed  to  send  this  bail  order  to  the 

Magistrate  Court  of  Mawanella  and  Officer-in-Charge  of  the  Police 

Station, Mawanella. 

K.M.G.H. Kulatunga, J.   

I agree.
