P.Kumararatnam,J. 

The Petitioner is the mother of the 5th Suspect (Hereinafter referred to as 

the  Suspect)  in  the  Magistrate  Court  of  Colombo  case  No.  B 

82604/01/2022. 

The Suspect had joined the 3rd Suspect (Skipper) as a crew member in 

multi day fishing vessel “IMUL-A-0164 CHW Kanan Du Bashi” which set 

sailed  on  a  multi-day  fishing  expedition  from  the  Tangalle  Fisheries

Harbour  in  early  November  2022.  The  said  vessel  was  arrested  by  Sri 

Lanka  Navy  in  the  deep  sea  for  carrying  a  cargo  of  narcotics.  The 

substances recovered from the possession of the Suspect and the others 

reacted 

for  Methamphetamine  and  Heroin.  The  gross  quantity 

Methamphetamine  weighed  about  128.327  kilograms  and  the  gross 

quantity  Heroin  is  weighed  about  106.474  kilogram.  The  Suspect  and 

other persons were handed over to the Police Narcotics Bureau Colombo-

01 on 18.12.2022.       

The  Suspect  and  others  were  produced  and  facts  were  reported  to  the 

Colombo  Magistrate  Court  under  Section  54A  (b)  (c)  and  (d)  of  the 

Poisons, Opium and Dangerous Drugs Ordinance as amended by the Act 

No.13  of  1984  and  a  detention  order  was  obtained  for  further 

investigations under Section 82(3) of the said Act. 

The production had been sent to the Government Analyst Department on 

10/01/2023. After analysis, the Government Analyst had forwarded the 

report  to  the  Court  on  08/09/2023.  According  to  the  Government 

Analyst,  1.18504  kilograms  of  pure  Heroin  (Diacetylmorphine)  and 

54.9837  kilograms  of  Methamphetamine  had  been  detected  from  the 

substances sent for the analysis. 

The Petitioner has pleaded following exceptional circumstances in 

support of the Bail Application.  

1.  The Suspect has been incarcerated for a period of 29 months. 

2.  Indictment has not gone yet. 

3.  The Suspect is married and his wife only 22 years.  

Learned  State  Counsel  submitted  that  the  delay  is  not  an  exceptional 

circumstance  to be considered to enlarge the  suspect on bail. Further, 

the  time  spent  for  preparing  the  indictment  does  not  constitute  an 

exceptional circumstance.  

3 | P a g e  

 
 
CA Bail 411-2024 

Exceptional circumstances are not defined in the statute. Hence, what is 

exceptional  circumstances  must  be  considered  on  its  own  facts  and 

circumstances on a case by case. 

In  Ramu  Thamodarampillai  v.  The  Attorney  General  [2004]  3  SLR 

180 the court held that: 

“the decision must in each case depend on its own peculiar facts and 

circumstances”.  

The Section 83 of the Poison, Opium and Dangerous Drugs Act which 

was amended by Act No. 41 of 2022 states: 

 83. (1) Subject to the provisions of sections 84, 85 and subsection (2) of 

this section, a person suspected or accused of an offence under sections 

54A and 54B of this Ordinance, shall not be released on bail by the High 

Court except in exceptional circumstances.  

(2)  Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of  sections  84  and  85,  a  person 

suspected or accused of an offence under subsection (1) of section 54A 

and section 54B- 

(a)  of  which  the  pure  quantity  of  the  dangerous  drug,  trafficked, 

imported, exported, or possessed is ten grammes or above in terms 

of the report issued by the Government Analyst under section 77A; 

and 

(b) which is punishable with death or life imprisonment,  

shall not be released on bail except by the Court of Appeal in exceptional 

circumstances. 

In this case, the pure quantity of Heroin detected in the production by 

the Government Analyst is 1.18504 kilograms and the 54.9837 kilograms 

of  Methamphetamine.  Hence,  this  court  has  jurisdiction  to  consider 

granting of bail as per the new amendment.

CA Bail 411-2024 

According to the Learned State Counsel, investigations notes had been 

received by the Attorney General’s Department and registered under AG 

reference  No.  CR3/591/2023.  Instructions  had  been  given  to  the  1st 

Respondent  to  conduct  further  investigation  considering  the  pure 

quantities of drugs detected in this case.    

I agree with the learned State Counsel that the factual and evidentiary 

matters pertain to the investigations can only be tested at the trial upon 

the witnesses being cross examined and shall not be tested at the time of 

hearing this bail application considering the nature of this case. 

Further, I do not consider the delay about 29 months in remand falls into 

the  category  of  excessive  and  oppressive  delay  considering  the 

circumstances of this case. 

The Offence under Section 54A(b) (c) and (d) of the Poisons Opium and 

Dangerous Drugs Ordinance as amended by the Act No.13 of 1984 is a 

serious offence and the seriousness of the offence should be considered 

when bail is considered.  

In  Ranil  Charuka  Kulatunga  v.  Attorney  General  CA  (PHC)  APN 

134/2015 the court held that: 

“The quantity of cocaine involved in this case is 62.847 grams, 

which is a commercial quantity. If Petitioner is convicted, the 

punishment  is  death  or  life  imprisonment.  Under  these 

circumstances, it is prudent to conclude the trial early while 

the Petitioner is kept in custody.” 

In  this  case  pure  Heroin  detected  is  1.18504  kilograms  and  pure 

Methamphetamine is 54.9837 kilograms. Which are certainly very high 

commercial  quantities.  Considering  the  seriousness  of  the  sentence 

prescribed under the Poison, Opium and Dangerous Drugs Ordinance, 

there is a high risk of absconding.     

5 | P a g e  

 
 
 
CA Bail 411-2024 

Considering all these factors into account, especially the pure quantity 

of Heroin and the Methamphetamine detected, and other circumstances 

of the case, I consider this is not the appropriate time to grant bail to the 

Suspect. 

Hence, this bail application is dismissed. 

The  Registrar  of  this  Court  is  directed  to  send  this  Bail  Order  to  the 

Magistrate  Court  of  Colombo  and  Officer-in-Charge  of  the  Police 

Narcotics Bureau, Colombo-01. 

K.M.S.Dissanayake, J.   

I agree.
