ORDER 

1.  This is an application preferred under Section 83(2) of Poisons, Opium 

and  Dangerous  Drugs  Ordinance  by  the  petitioner  on  behalf  of  the 

suspect-respondent.  According  to  the  petitioner,  the  suspect  was 

arrested on 06.09.2023 for the alleged possession of 54.4 grammes of 

amphetamine.  Then,  a  second  recovery  of  50.9  grammes  had  been 

made upon his arrest. The pure quantities according to the Government 

Analyst’s  Report  dated  08.01.2024  are  20.87  and  18.36  grammes 

respectively.  

2.  The  petitioner  denied  the  alleged  possession  and  alleges  a  false 

introduction. Those being the facts, the exceptionality urged is an eye 

condition  of  the  accused’s  which  is  a  ground  based  on  ill  health. 

According to Mr. Sajith Senanayake AAL, due to an accident some time 

ago, the suspect had sustained an injury to his right eye and was losing 

Page 2 of 4 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
BAL-0269-24 

his  sight  since  2016.  Similarly,  due  to  a  diabetics  related  traumatic 

glaucoma condition has now developed in his left eye and is losing his 

eye sight in that eye too. In support a clinic report depicting his current 

glaucoma  condition  was  tendered  to  this  court  along  with  a  motion. 

This confirms ‘glaucoma of L/eye’. The learned State Counsel conceded 

that the said condition affecting the eye is a health condition. However, 

submitted that he can and is now been treated and receiving necessary 

treatment from the Prison Hospital.  

3.  The petitioner has no previous convictions or pending cases either. He 

had been in remand for one year and five months. The learned State 

Counsel  submitted  that  the  indictment  had  been  dispatched  on 

29.01.2025 under AG’s reference CR3/449/2024.  

4.  The suspect losing his sight in the right eye may be due to a previous  

incident but now his left eye is being afflicted by a state of glaucoma, 

which is said to be affecting his sight in the left eye. To my mind, this 

would  constitute  a  ground  of  ill-health  that  may  be  considered 

exceptional. The State Counsel, no doubt, submitted that treatment is 

available  in  the  Prison  Hospital.  A  person  who  is  threatened  with 

blindness in this context, and considering the dynamics of glaucoma, 

such  persons  will  certainly  require  optimum  conditions  to  maintain 

their health. It is a notorious fact that conditions within the precincts 

of the remand prisons is far from optimum.  

5.  It  is  common  ground  that  the  there  is  no  report  of  any  previous 

convictions  nor  pending  matters.  No  doubt,  an  indictment  has  been 

dispatched on 29.01.2021. It is not the dispatching of the indictment 

that  is  relevant,  but  taking  one  year  and  five  months  to  forward  the 

same and the absence of a reasonable explanation for taking such time. 

All in all, considering the totality of the circumstances that is unique to 

the  suspect  cumulatively  may  be  considered  exceptional.  Thus,  the 

suspect is entitled to be granted bail under Section 83 (2). Accordingly,

bail is granted to the suspect Athige Sandeep Kanishka Silva, subject 

to the following conditions: 

BAL-0269-24 

1.  cash bail in a sum of Rs. 50,000.00;  

2.  to provide two sureties who should execute bonds to the value of 

Rs.  500,000.00  each  and  one  of  the  sureties  should  be  a  close 

relative of the suspect; 

3.  Sureties  are  required  to  provide  certificates  from  the  Grama 

Sevaka from the respective residential areas of such sureties; 

4.  to surrender the Passport or any travel document of the suspect if 

he has any, to the Registrar of the Magistrate’s Court of Mahara;  

5.  to report to the Officer-in-Charge of the Police Narcotics Bureau on 

last Sunday of every month before 12 noon; and  

6.  further, a travel ban is imposed until the final determination of this 

matter  and  the  Registrar  is  directed  to  inform  the  Controller  of 

Immigration and Emigration of this order for necessary action. 

6.  This application is accordingly allowed and the Registrar of this Court is 

directed  to  transmit  a  copy  of  this  order  to  the  Registrar  of  the 

Magistrate’s Court of Mahara. 

 P. Kumararatnam, J. 

 I agree.
