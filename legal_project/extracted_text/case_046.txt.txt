DECIDED ON:      19.03.2025  

K.M.G.H. KULATUNGA, J. 

ORDER 

1.  This  application  is  preferred  under  Section  83(2)  of  the  Poisons, 

Opium  and  Dangerous  Drugs  Ordinance.  The  accused-petitioner, 

Galhena Hewage Prasanna Priyanjith is seeking bail for himself. The 

petitioner  had  been  arrested  on  05.02.2019  for  the  alleged 

possession  of  79.01  kg  of  pure  heroin.  The  petitioner  now  stands 

indicted  in  the  High  Court  of  Homagama  with  two  counts  for 

possession and trafficking of 79.015 kg of heroin. 

2.  The  main  ground  of  exceptionality  urged  is  the  delay  of  six  years 

from the date of arrest. The indictment has been filed on 08.02.2021. 

However,  the  complaint  is  that  the  trial  is  still  pending  with  no 

Page 2 of 9 

 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
                    
 
 
         BAL-0305-24 

certainty as to when it may conclude. Further trial is now scheduled 

for  28.03.2025.  It  is  also  submitted  that  there  was  a  delay  in  the 

commencement  of  the  trial  as  the  main  investigating  officer  has 

vacated post. The prosecution has now led the evidence of PW-4 and 

is yet to be cross-examined.  

3.  The learned Counsel relying on the presumption of innocence and 

the provisions of Articles 12 and 13 of the Constitution submitted 

that this delay is a blatant denial of a fair trial and is attributable to 

the absence of witness No.01, the main  raiding officer. It was also 

contended  that  the  accused  is  presumed  innocent  and  the 

continuous denial of his freedom and liberty is a serious violation of 

his rights guaranteed under Article 13 of the Constitution and the 

accused is thus entitled to be enlarged on bail on that score alone. 

4.  The learned President’s Counsel did concede of a previous conviction 

in 2015 for an offence under Section 298 of the Penal Code and that 

a  sentence  of  two  years  imposed  was  suspended  for  five  years. 

Therefore, the present arrest had been made during the operational 

period of the said suspended sentence. It was the learned President’s 

Counsel’s argument that the previous conviction was for a different 

offence and has nothing to do with narcotics. He also submitted that 

the prosecution will not be able to prove exclusive possession as his 

mother and father also lived in the house in which the recovery was 

alleged to have been made. Finally, it was submitted that this delay 

and the denial of his rights under the Constitution when considered 

in conjunction with the apparent weakness will constitute amount 

circumstances that is exceptional which entitles the accused to be 

granted bail under Section 83(2).

5.  In  opposition  and  by  way  of  objection,  the  learned  State  Counsel 

submitted that the first raid was conducted along the Marine Drive, 

where ten packets containing 7.753 kg of heroin was detected from 

two others  and  on information provided by them the accused  was 

arrested  in  his  house  at  Homagama  where  a  hundred  parcels  of 

heroin was found concealed under his bed.  

6.  The  learned  State  Counsel’s  position  was  that  though  almost  six 

years had elapsed the delay in the circumstances of this case is not 

undue,  excessive  or  oppressive.  The  State  Counsel  traced  the 

timeline  and  the  events  to  explain  and  support  her  position.  The 

detection had been on 05.02.2019. IB Extracts have been forwarded 

to the Attorney General on 10.02.2020. Then, under AG’s reference 

CR3/73/2020 the indictment has been signed on 08.02.2021 which 

had been received in the High Court on 23.02.2021. PW-1 had been 

summoned  on  14.12.2022.  It  is  conceded  that  PW-1  was  not 

available. The matter had been taken off the trial roll and called on 

20.02.2023, 30.03.2023, 16.05.2023 and 20.06.2023 as the defence 

had requested for certain documents and copies of notes. Then, it 

had been fixed for trial 24.10.2023 but the trial has not commenced 

and  then  26.02.2024  the  matter  had  been  postponed  as  the  High 

Court Judge was on leave. However, the trial had finally commenced 

on 30.09.2024 with PW-4.  

7.  It  was  therefore  argued  that  the  prosecution  has  sent  out  the 

indictment without delay and postponements and dates have been 

granted  inter  alia  on  application  made  by  the  defence  as  well.  In 

support of the objection, she referred to a previous decision of this 

Court in CA/Bail/61/2023 and submitted that bail was refused to

         BAL-0305-24 

a  suspect  who  was  in  remand  for  eight  years  as  the  quantity  of 

heroin was 31 kg.  

8.  On the face of it, this Accused has been in remand since his arrest, 

for  almost  six  years.  However,  the  provisions  of  Section  83  (2)  as 

amended by Act, No. 41 of 2022, decrees that a person accused or 

suspected of being in possession of 10 grammes or more, is required 

to be kept in remand, unless such person satisfies this Court as to 

the existence of circumstances that are exceptional. Section 83 as 

amended  by 

the  Poisons,  Opium  and  Dangerous  Drugs 

(Amendment) Act, No. 41 of 2022 reads thus; 

83.  (1)  Subject  to  the  provisions  of  sections  84,  85  and 
subsection (2) of this section, a person suspected or accused of 
an offence under sections 54A and 54B of this Ordinance, shall 
not be released on bail by the High Court except in exceptional 
circumstances. 

(2) Notwithstanding the provisions of sections 84 and 85, 
a person suspected or accused of an -  

(a)  of  which  the  pure  quantity  of  the  dangerous 
drug, trafficked, imported, exported or possessed 
is  ten  grammes  or  above  in  terms  of  the  report 
issued  by  the  Government  Analyst  under  section 
77A; and  
(b)  which 
life 
imprisonment,[sic]  shall  not  be  released  on  bail 
except  by  the  Court  of  Appeal  in  exceptional 
circumstances.  

is  punishable  with  death  or 

(3)  For  the  purposes  of  this  section  “dangerous  drug” 
means 
and 
Methamphetamine.” 

Morphine, 

Cocaine, 

Heroin 

9.   No doubt, under the normal law during pre-trial and pre-conviction 

stages granting of bail is the rule and the refusal is the exception. 

This is in accord with the presumption of innocence which prevails 

during  the  pendency  of  the  trial.  However,  when  exceptional 

Page 5 of 9 

 
 
 
 
 
         BAL-0305-24 

circumstances  are  by  statute  decreed  as  being  a  necessary 

prerequisite,  then  the  legislature  has  intended  that,  persons 

accused  of  such  offences  be  held  in  remand  pending  the 

determination of such trials.  

10. Section  83  in  the  first  instance  requires  that  person  suspected  of 

offences  involving  over  10  grammes  or  more  of  pure  narcotics  is 

required  to  be  denied  bail.  This  is  couched  the  mandatory  form. 

However, the discretion is conferred to consider bail in exceptional 

circumstances. This provision does not  create an entitlement  as of 

right to obtain bail by establishing exceptional circumstances. In the 

Converse a discretion is conferred on the Court to consider bail. The 

end result is that making out exceptional circumstances per se will 

neither  entitle  a  suspect  as  of  a  right  to  be  enlarged  on  bail  nor 

compel this Court to grant bail. It is a discretion that is conferred. 

11. In 

the  exercise  of 

the  said  discretion  when  exceptional 

circumstances are made out, this Court (if brought to its notice) may 

consider other factors such as flight risk, propensity of reoffending 

or absconding and if there be such circumstances, bail may not be 

granted even if exceptional circumstances are made out. Presence of 

exceptional circumstances will not ipso facto mandate the granting 

of bail. 

12. Section 83(2) applies to a very limited category of narcotic offences, 

where bail is denied unless the persons who are suspected or charged 

with 

these  offences  are  able 

to  demonstrate  exceptional 

circumstances.   As  I  see,  the  Legislature  has  by  special  bail 

provisions  in  Section  83(2)  established  an  effective  bail  system  for 

specific narcotic offences for which the normal bail regime would not 

suffice  and  allow  the  continuity  of  the  criminal  behaviour  and  the 

Page 6 of 9 

 
 
 
 
 
 
         BAL-0305-24 

risk  of  absconding.   This  is  primarily  in  view  of  the  unique  nature 

and attributes of the narcotics offences. Unlike most other run of the 

mill type of offences, most narcotics offences are committed in a very 

different  context.   For  instance,  trafficking  in  narcotics  occurs 

systematically,  usually  in  a  highly  sophisticated  and  organised 

manner, that is extremely lucrative.  This by itself is a huge incentive 

for  an  offender  to  continue  with  the  criminal  behaviour  even  after 

arrest  and  release  on  bail.   Then  in  view  of  the  serious  penal 

sanctions  that  may  entail  there  is  also  the  appreciable  and  real 

danger of such accused or suspects absconding.   

13. Now  to  consider  if  the  accused  in  this  matter  is  entitled  to  any 

benefit or if there be any ground that may be considered in his favour 

to  grant  bail.  Being  in  remand  for  almost  six  years  is  by  itself  an 

appreciable  and  a  considerable  time  period.  In  the  normal  course, 

one would reasonably expect a trial to  have  concluded  during that 

period.  However,  it  appears  in  view  of  the  several  events  and 

eventualities, time taken is somewhat longer than usual. 

14. The  journal  entries  and  proceedings  of  the  High  Court  are  made 

available with the petition (vide- P-5 and P-6). The accused had been 

indicted quite expeditiously. It is the trial that has taken time. The 

reasons are many. For instance, as evident by the journal entries and 

the proceedings, the matter had been postponed on 15.06.2022 due 

to a  JSC circular  in relation to Covid. Then, due to the  absence of 

witness No. 01 and 04 (14.12.2022 and 20.02.2023). Similarly, when 

the matter was scheduled for the trial, requests for the documents 

have  been  made  by  the  defence  and  once  again  adjourned  on 

20.02.2023. Then, the State Counsel who was specially assigned had 

been absent (20.02.2023). However, the trial had finally commenced 

on 30.09.2024 with PW-4. Therefore, the commencement of the trial 

Page 7 of 9 

 
 
 
 
 
         BAL-0305-24 

has  been  delayed  due  to  the  cumulative  effect  of  all  the  aforesaid 

reasons. It cannot be solely or mainly be attributed to the prosecution 

alone.  

15. The next relevant matter is that this offence is alleged to have been 

committed  during  the  operational  period  of  a  suspended  sentence. 

No doubt, the said previous conviction is said to be an offence under 

Section  298  may  be  connected  to  a  road  traffic  accident.  What  is 

relevant is not the nature of the previous conviction but the fact that 

he  was  subject  to  an  active  suspended  sentence.  Whatever  the 

previous  offence  may  have  been,  a  person  who  is  subject  to  a 

suspended sentence is required to conduct himself in such a manner 

to avoid the commission any subsequent offence during that period. 

If  so,  he  would  be  liable  to  suffer  and  serve  the  sentence  so 

suspended. 

16. The accused was subject to a suspended sentence. Now he is alleged 

to have been detected with a very large haul of narcotics  this time 

round (79 kg of heroin).  This shows a propensity to engage in acts 

of  criminal  nature  and  reoffend.  When  a  person  is  alleged  to  have 

committed a subsequent offence during the operational period it also 

exhibits a tendency  to reoffend, commit or get involved in criminal 

activities  with  impunity.  This  is  indicative  of  a  contemptuous 

disregard  of  the  authority  of  such  Court.  The  alleged  subsequent 

offence, if true, in this instance is extremely serious. 79 kg of pure 

heroin  is  critical  and  is  consistent  with  a  large-scale  trafficking  of 

narcotics of a commercial nature.  

17. In  the  above  premises,  even  if  the  petitioner  has  established 

exceptional circumstances, as the other facts establish a propensity 

to reoffend the accused is not entitled for bail under Section 83(2).

Accordingly, this Court is left with no option but to refuse and reject 

this application. The application is accordingly dismissed.  

18. Application is dismissed and the Registrar of this Court is directed to 

transmit  a  copy  of  this  order  to  the  Registrar  of  the  High  Court  of 

Homagama and the Superintendent of Excise of the Excise Narcotics 

Bureau.
