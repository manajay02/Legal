ORDER 

1.  This  application  is  preferred  by  the  petitioner  seeking  bail  for  the  1st 

accused, Aruni Nadishika Palliyage under Section 83(2) of the Poisons, 

Opium and Dangerous Drugs Ordinance. The 1st accused is alleged to 

have been arrested on 19.07.2021 by a group of Police Officers attached 

to the Colombo Crimes Division, Dematagoda (CCD). According to the 

B  Report  dated  20.07.2021,  the  group  of  Police  Officers  acting  on 

information has raided at a house at Rajamalwatta Terrace, Ja-Ela. In 

the said house the 1st accused along with another were found packeting 

heroin.  The  quantity  of  heroin  found  was  1.15kg  and  a  sum  of  Rs. 

868,900.00  was  also  recovered.  Further,  a  digital  weighing  scale  was 

also found at the place.  

2.  The  1st  accused  along  with  another  now  stands  indicted  in  the  High 

Court of Negombo under the case No. HC/80/23. The indictment has 

been dispatched on 25.07.2023. Upon the conclusion of the pre-trial on 

30.10.2024 the trial has commenced on 20.01.2025 and also taken up 

on 24.02.2025. The evidence of Witness No.01 had been concluded and 

is now scheduled for further trial on 27.05.2025.  

3.  According to the learned Counsel for the petitioner, the main grounds 

urged are delay and ill-health. As for the delay, it was submitted that

BAL-0372-24 

pre-trial taking eleven months is excessive.  The learned Counsel also 

urged that in view of the backlog of cases in the High Court of Negombo, 

there is no reasonable prospect of this trial concluding soon.  

4.  As  for  delay,  in  Attorney  General  v.  Ediriweera  (S.C.  Appeal  No. 

100/2005),  it  was  held  that  “Delay  is  always  a  relative  term  and  the 

question to be considered is not whether there was mere explicable delay, 

as  when  there  is  a  backlog  of  cases,  but  whether  there  has  been 

excessive or oppressive delay and this always depends on the facts and 

circumstances of the case…”. 

5.  Lapse of time or the time taken at various stages of the criminal process 

is thus a relative term depending on the circumstances of each case. It 

is common knowledge and a notorious fact that due to the backlog of 

cases, delays in the judicial process are prevalent. This may vary from 

court to court. This is a circumstance common to all cases pending in 

such respective court. Can such a circumstance common to all become 

or be considered as being exceptional in respect of a selected case?  

6.  The word “exceptional" is commonly used in legislation. One definition 

of it in the New Shorter Oxford English Dictionary is: "Of the nature 

of or forming an exception, unusual, out of the ordinary, special" (vol. 1 

p.872).  According  to  the  Webster’s  Dictionary  “exceptional"  is: 

"Relating to or forming an exception, out of the ordinary course, unusual, 

uncommon,  extraordinary".    Thus,  to  my  mind,  delay  common  to  all 

cases cannot become or be considered as being exceptional in respect 

of a selected case in such court. 

7.  The learned State Counsel opposing this application submitted that the 

indictment has been dispatched within a reasonable period of time and 

now the trial is in progress. Thus, there is no undue or excessive delay 

in instituting action and the trial is now proceeding.

8.  Next ground urged is ill-health. As for ill-health, it was submitted that 

the  1st  accused  has  contracted  Tuberculosis  (TB)  whilst  in  remand. 

Apart from the assertion that she had contracted TB, nothing further 

was submitted in support or establish that it is either life-threatening 

or is not possible to be effectively treated whilst in remand, or that it is 

the current status of health. Thus, this ground is not substantiated. 

9.  It  is  common  ground  that  the  accused  has  five  previous  convictions. 

According to the State Counsel, the said previous convictions are; 

i. 

a narcotics offence in the High Court of Galle, bearing case 

No.  3747/2013 – the accused had been found guilty and a 

fine  of  Rs.60,000.00  and  one  year  jail  term  has  been 

suspended for ten years; 

ii. 

four cases in the Magistrate’s Court for  the possession of 

heroin for which fines have been imposed; and  

iii. 

a pending case for possession of a firearm and ammunition.  

10. The Legislature, by incorporating special bail provisions in Section 83, 

has established an effective bail system for specific narcotic offences for 

which the normal bail regime would not suffice. This was also to prevent 

reoffending or the continuity of such criminal behaviour and the risk of 

absconding.   This  is  primarily  in  view  of  the  unique  nature  and 

particular  dynamics  of  narcotic  offences.  Unlike  most  other  offences, 

narcotic offences are committed in a very different context.  For instance, 

trafficking in narcotics occurs systematically in a highly sophisticated 

and organised manner. It also is extremely lucrative.  This by itself is a 

compelling  incentive  for  an  offender  to  continue  with  the  criminal 

behaviour  even  after  arrest  and  release  on  bail.   This  propensity  is 

evident in this instance by the previous convictions and pending matter. 

Similarly in view of the serious penal sanctions that may entail there is 

also  the  appreciable  and  real  danger  of  such  accused  or  suspects 

absconding.

11. Therefore, repeated offending in the form of previous convictions, the 

quantity being of a commercial nature and a pending case are relevant 

in considering bail under Section 83(2).  

12. In  the  above  circumstances,  we  see  no  lawful  basis  to  allow  this 

application  and  are  left  with  no  option  but  to  reject  and  dismiss  this 

application.
