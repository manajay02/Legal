DECIDED ON: 

03.04.2025 

K.M.G.H. KULATUNGA, J. 

ORDER 

1.  This  application  is  preferred  by  the  petitioner  seeking  bail  for  the 

suspect, Mohamed Hanifa Mohamed Siyamdeen under Section 83(2) of 

the Poisons, Opium and Dangerous Drugs Ordinance. The suspect is 

alleged  to  have  been  arrested  on  19.06.2023  by  a  group  of  Police 

Officers attached to the Colombo Crimes Division, Dematagoda (CCD). 

According to the B Report dated 20.06.2023, the group of Police Officers 

acting on information has apprehended the suspect at his house. At the 

point of the apprehension the suspect was alleged to have had a bag in 

his hand in which another transparent bag containing 215.1 grammes 

of methamphetamine was detected.  

2.  According  to  the  Government  Analyst’s  Report  dated  07.11.2023,  the 

pure quantity of the said substance is 33 grammes. The only ground of 

exceptionality  advanced  is  the  delay  of  one  year  and  eight  months 

without  instituting  criminal  action.  The  petitioner  admits  of  one 

previous conviction  on 24.09.2019 in which upon pleading  guilty the 

suspect  had  been  imposed  with  a  fine  during  the  inquiry.  It  was 

admitted  that  the  said  previous  conviction  was  in  respect  of  a  small 

quantity of heroin.

3.  According to the State Counsel, the Attorney General had received the 

IB  Extracts  on  18.02.2024  and  is  registered  under  AG’s  Reference 

CR3/295/2024. It was further submitted that the quantity found in the 

possession  is  a  commercial  quantity.  The  petitioner’s  ground  of 

exceptionality as aforesaid is primarily the delay of fifteen months. As 

at  the  date  of  inquiry,  the  suspect  had  been  in  remand  for  almost 

twenty-one  months.  Depriving  the  liberty  and  living  for  a  period  of 

twenty-one  months  of  any  person  is  substantial  and  serious. 

Considering  the  average  lifespan  this  is  a  substantial  portion  of  the 

youthful living of any person. It is in view of this observation that this 

Court  has  time  and  again  found  that  time  held  in  remand,  without 

meaningful action being taken unless reasonably explained, would be 

considered  as  excessive,  oppressive  and  undue.  Such  unexplained 

delay  will  necessarily  be  considered  as  being  an  exceptional 

circumstance within the meaning of Section 83(2) for the purposes of 

bail. 

4.  This  raid  and  recovery  are  clearly  straightforward  and  an 

uncomplicated. The Government Analyst’s Report was available  since 

07.11.2023 and the IBEs have been forwarded to the Attorney General 

on  18.02.2024.  This  is  admitted  by  the  learned  State  Counsel.  The 

indictment  has  not  been  dispatched  up  until  the  date  of  inquiry 

(11.03.2025).  The  respondents  including  the  Attorney  General  had 

notice  of  this  application  at  least  by  10.12.2024  upon  the  service  of 

notice. It does not appear that the relevant officer responsible has taken 

any meaningful steps to dispatch the indictment promptly and without 

delay.  The  failure  to  finalize  and  dispatch  indictment  even  after  the 

lapse  of  one  year  clearly  demonstrates  an  extremely  lackadaisical 

approach  and  being  oblivious  to  or  not  conscious  the  suspect  is 

languishing in remand indefinitely. This conduct, in the absence of any 

plausible  reason,  should  certainly  be  considered  as  an  exceptional 

circumstance for the purposes of bail.

5.  Accordingly,  as  we  are  satisfied  that  the  said  circumstances  can  be 

considered as being exceptional, the suspect is granted bail subject to 

the following conditions: 

BAL-0418-24 

i. 

ii. 

cash bail in a sum of Rs. 50,000.00;  

to provide two sureties who should execute bonds to the value 

of  Rs.  500,000.00  each,  and  one  of  the  sureties  should  be  a 

close relative of the suspect; 

iii. 

sureties  are  required  to  provide  certificates  from  the  Grama 

Sevaka of the respective residential areas of such sureties; 

iv. 

to surrender the Passport or any travel document of the suspect 

if  he  has  any,  to  the  Registrar  of  the  Magistrate’s  Court  of 

Maligakanda;  

v. 

to  report  to  the  Officer-in-Charge  of  the  Colombo  Crimes 

Division, Dematagoda on last Sunday of every month before 12 

noon; and  

vi. 

further, a travel ban is imposed until the final determination of 

this matter and the Registrar is directed to inform the Controller 

General  of  Immigration  and  Emigration  of  this  Order  for 

necessary action. 

6.  This  application  is  accordingly  allowed.  The  Registrar  of  this  Court  is 

directed  to  transmit  a  copy  of  this  Order  to  the  Registrar  of  the 

Magistrate’s Court of Maligakanda. 

 P. Kumararatnam, J. 

 I agree.
