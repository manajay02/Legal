D. Thotawatte, J. 

This  is  a  matter  where  the  Officer-in-Charge  of  Kuruwita  Police  filed  information  in  the 
Magistrate's Court of Rathnapura under Section 66(1) of the Primary Courts Procedure Act No. 
44 of 1979 regarding a dispute between the 1st Party-Respondent-Petitioner and her brother and 
the brother’s wife, 2nd Party-Petitioner-Respondentsover possession of a shop.  

At  the  conclusion  of  the  Magistrate  court  inquiry,  the  Learned  Magistrate  had  delivered  a 
judgment  on  14/09/2023  in  favor  of  the  1st  Party-Respondent-Petitioner,  recognizing  her 
possession. The 2nd Party-Petitioner-Respondent, being aggrieved by the said order, had filed a 
revision application (RA/56/23) before the High Court of Rathnapura. After the conclusion of the 
hearing, the Hon. Judge of the High Court had by order dated 24/02/2025 set aside the Learned 
Magistrate’s judgement giving possession of the impugned premises to the 2nd Party-Petitioner-
Respondent. 

Being aggrieved by the judgement of the Hon. Judge of the High Court, the 1st Party-Respondent-
Petitioner has filed this instant application to revise the said judgment. 

Having  heard  both  parties  I  am  satisfied  that  there  is  a  prima  facie  case  to  be  considered  and 
further  considering  the  submissions  made  by  counsel,  in  order  to  maintain  the  status  quo  till 
final determination of this application the court grants the interim relief prayed for in Prayer (c) 
and  (d)  of  the  petition  staying  the  operation  and  execution  of  the  judgment  of  High  Court  of 
Rathnapura case bearing number RA/56/23dated 24-02-2005. 

The Court issues formal notice on all the respondents. 

Sarath Dissanayake, J.
