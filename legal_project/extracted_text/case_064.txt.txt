The Petitioners are seeking, inter alia, a writ of certiorari quashing the order made by the 

1st Respondent, Officer in Charge, Secret Intelligence Unit of Commission to Investigate 

Allegations of Bribery and Corruption, directing the Petitioners to produce the vehicle in 

dispute for investigation (P25) and a writ of Prohibition preventing the 1 st Respondent 

from making any arrests on the Petitioners. 

Moreover, the Petitioners are seeking several interim orders including the relief not to 

make any order to arrest the Petitioners until the final determination of this application.

When the matter was taken up for support on 27/01/2025, the learned Counsel for the 

1st and 2nd Respondents raised a preliminary objection as to the maintainability of this 

application. It was contended by the Counsel  for the 1st and 2nd Respondents  that this 

Court  lacks  jurisdiction to  entertain the present application, relying  on the clear  and 

unambiguous wording of Section 160 of the Anti Corruption Act No. 9 of 2023, which 

expressly vests  exclusive jurisdiction in the Supreme Court, ousting the jurisdiction of 

this  Court,  in  respect  of  any  application  seeking  relief  against  the Anti  Corruption 

Commission.  The 1st and  2nd Respondents  maintain  that  any  challenge  to  the 

Commission’s decisions, whether concerning investigations or the conduct of its officers 

acting in an official capacity, must be brought directly before the Supreme Court by way 

of  a  Writ  application  and  the  Petitioners’  recourse  to  this  Court  is fundamentally 

misconceived in law. 

It is submitted by the Petitioners that the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal remains 

intact as their challenge is directed against the alleged ultra vires actions of the officers of 

the Anti Corruption Commission and not against the Commission itself. It is submitted 

that Section 160(1) of the Anti-Corruption Act, which vests exclusive jurisdiction in the 

Supreme Court for relief sought against the Commission, does not oust the jurisdiction 

of this court as the Commission is merely impleaded as a necessary party.  

An excerpt of Section 160 of the Anti Corruption Act, No. 9 Of 2023 is as follows: 

160. (1) The jurisdiction vested in the Court of Appeal by Article 140 of the Constitution 

shall,  in  respect  of  applications in  which  relief is  sought  against  the  Commission  be 

exercised by the Supreme Court and not by the Court of Appeal.  

(2) Subject to the provisions of subsection (1), no injunction or enjoining order shall be 

granted by any court restraining or staying, or having the effect of restraining or staying, 

the Commission, from commencing or continuing, the conduct of an investigation under 

this Act or from exercising any of the powers conferred on it by this Act or from giving 

any direction under this Act 

3 

 
The threshold issue before this Court concerns its jurisdiction to hear this matter in light 

of Section 160 of the Anti Corruption Act. This provision serves as an unequivocal ouster 

clause  that  modifies  the  ordinary  jurisdictional  framework  of  the  Court  of  Appeal, 

established by Article 140 of the Constitution. The language of Section 160(1) is clear and 

mandatory and  it transfers jurisdiction from this Court to the Supreme Court for any 

application seeking relief against the Commission. 

The Petitioners have submitted that reliefs sought are against actions by officers of the 

Commission rather than the Commission itself. The officers in question were acting in 

their official capacity as agents of the Commission, exercising statutory powers delegated 

to them under the Act. The relationship between the Anti Corruption Commission and 

its officers may be likened to that of a ship and its crew. The Commission is the legal 

entity  vested  with  statutory  authority  to  navigate  the  waters  of  anti  corruption 

investigations.  The  officers  act  under  the  Commission’s  command,  carrying  out  its 

mission  of  steering,  maintaining,  and  operating  the  vessel  in  accordance  with  its 

designated functions. Their actions were undertaken on behalf of and for the purposes of 

the Commission. To allow such challenges to proceed in this Court would permit litigants 

to circumvent Parliament's clear intent. 

Section  160(2)  reinforces this  interpretation  by expressly  prohibiting any  court  from 

granting  injunctions  or  enjoining  orders  that  would  restrain  the  Commission's 

investigative  functions.  This  demonstrates  Parliament's  intention  to  shield  the 

Commission's  operations  from  judicial  interference,  except  through  Supreme  Court 

review.  

Having  considered  these  factors,  it  is  my  view  that  this  Court  lacks  jurisdiction  to 

entertain the present application. The attempt to characterize the challenge as targeting 

individual  officers rather than the Commission  constitutes an  impermissible effort to 

avoid  the  statutory  ouster  of  this  Court's  jurisdiction.  The  proper  forum  for  such 

grievances  is  the  Supreme  Court,  as  expressly  provided  by  Section  160  of  the  Anti 

Corruption Act.

Accordingly, the preliminary objection is upheld. The application is dismissed for lack of 

jurisdiction, I make no order as to costs. The application is dismissed. 

Application dismissed. No costs.
