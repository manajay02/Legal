MOHAMMED LAFFAR, J. (President, Court of Appeal- Acting) 

The Petitioner, the Trustee of the Khadeja Salih Trust Fund, aggrieved by the 
Order  dated  21.09.2019  issued  by  the  Wakfs  Tribunal,  has  sought  the 
revisionary jurisdiction of this Court to revise and set aside the said Order. 

The  Khadeja  Salih  Trust  Fund  was  established  on  11.12.1996  by  Hameed 
Hussain,  Marikkar  Mohamed,  and  Salih  Marikkar,  through  instruments 
attested by Hussain Ahmed, Attorney-at-Law and Notary Public. The Trust 
Deeds  were  registered  at  the  Puttalam  Land  Registry,  empowering  the 
Trustees to submit accounts, purchase or sell Trust property with the District 
Court's permission, and retain the proceeds as part of the Trust.  

The Petitioner received a notice on 24.12.2018, directing him to appear before 
the Tribunal on 05.01.2019. He informed the Tribunal via tele-mail and letter 
that he would be unavailable until after 20.01.2019 due to a planned Umra 
pilgrimage.  Despite  this,  the  Tribunal  proceeded  and  granted  him  one 
month  to  submit  accounts,  with  the  case  adjourned  to  16.03.2019.  The 
Petitioner submitted accounts for 2016-2018 on 16.04.2019 and informed the 
Tribunal accordingly. However, on 22.06.2019, the Tribunal inquired about 
the  Petitioner's  representation  in  a  related  case  (WT/202/2012)  and 
adjourned the matter to 06.07.2019. 

On 06.09.2019, the Petitioner's Attorney appeared before the Tribunal and 
was informed that the Petitioner had been removed as Trustee on 08.06.2019. 
The Tribunal directed the Petitioner to file proper papers within one month 
to vacate the removal order, failing which a formal order would be issued.  

The Petitioner filed a motion on 15.08.2019 to vacate the removal order, and 
the  Tribunal  refused  on  21.09.2019,  also  rejecting  objections  to  its 
jurisdiction. The Petitioner argues that the Tribunal erroneously interpreted 
the Trust Deed and the Wakfs Act, particularly Sections 9 and 35, and acted 
beyond  its  jurisdiction  by  attempting  to  appoint  a  new  Trustee,  a  power 
reserved for the District Court.

As the supreme authority overseeing Muslim charitable trusts, the Tribunal 
bears a fundamental responsibility to ensure the proper administration of 
trusts, and thereby Section 9E of the Wakfs Act confers broad powers on the 
Wakfs Tribunal which includes powers to remove Trustees; 

“(1) The powers of the Tribunal under this Act shall include the power to hear 
and determine any application made in respect of a Muslim charitable trust 
or wakfs for the order providing for all or any of the following purposes: 

(a) removing from office any trustee of the trust or wakfs; 

(b) appointing where necessary, a trustee or trustees for the trust or 
wakfs ; 

(c) directing the submission of statements of accounts to the Tribunal 
or the board; 

(d) declaring what proportion of the property of the trust or wakfs or 
of the interest therein shall be allocated to any specified object of the 
trust or wakfs ; 

(e) settling a scheme for the management of the trust or wakfs; 

(f)  directing  the  specific  performance  of  any  act  by  the  trustee  or 
trustees of the trust of wakfs; 

(g)  declaring  any  trustee  of  the  trust  or  wakfs  guilty  of  any 
misfeasance, breach of trust or neglect of duty; 

(h) ordering the payment by any trustee of the trust or  wakfs of any 
sum to the funds of the trust or wakfs by way of damages in respect of 
any misfeasance, breach of trust or neglect of duty; and 

(i)  granting  such  further  or  other  relief  arising  from  the  matters 
specified in paragraphs (a) to (h).” 

In  this  case,  the  Petitioner's  conduct  has  been  inconsistent  with  these 
principles.  Furthermore,  Section  35  of  the  Wakfs  Act  explicitly  requires 

3 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
trustees to furnish annual statements of accounts to the Board by the first 
day of June each year.  

“(1) It shall be the duty of the trustee or trustees of a Muslim charitable trust 
or  wakf  to  furnish  to  the  board  before  the  first  day  of  June  in  each  year  a 
statement of accounts in such form as may be prescribed relating to all moneys 
received and expended in respect of that trust or wakf during the period of 
twelve months ending on the thirty-first day of March of that year: 

Provided, however, that where the board is satisfied that such trustee 
or trustees will be unable to furnish such statement before the first day 
of  June  in  that  year,  the  board  may  allow  such  trustee  or  trustees 
further time for the purpose of furnishing such statement. 

(2) Every statement of accounts furnished under this section shall be 
signed by the trustee or trustees by whom the statement is furnished 
and shall contain a declaration that the particulars set out therein are 
true and accurate. Such declaration shall be free of stamp duty. 

(3) Every statement of accounts furnished under this section shall be 
in the language in which the accounts of the trust or wakf axe usually 
kept.” 

The  Petitioner  has  repeatedly  neglected  or  wilfully  suppressed  the 
submission  of  accounts,  thereby  violating  this  statutory  obligation.  His 
failure  to comply with  the Tribunal's  notices  and  directives,  including  his 
reliance  on  letters  rather  than  appearing  in  person,  is  tantamount  to 
contempt of court. 

The  Petitioner's  conduct,  including  his  failure  to  appear  and  his  delayed 
submissions, demonstrates a disregard for the Tribunal's authority and the 
legal obligations of a trustee. Such behaviour undermines the integrity of the 
trust and the confidence of its beneficiaries. 

In light of the above, it is evident that the Petitioner has failed to fulfil his 
duties as Trustee in accordance with the Wakfs Act and the directives of the 
Tribunal. The Tribunal's decision to remove the Petitioner as Trustee and its 

4 

 
 
 
 
refusal  to  vacate  the  removal  order  were  justified  given  the  Petitioner's 
repeated non compliance and neglect. The Petitioner's conduct has not only 
violated  statutory  provisions  but  has  also  undermined  the  proper 
management  of  the  Khadeja  Salih  Trust  Fund.  Therefore,  the  revisionary 
jurisdiction of this Court should not be exercised in favour of the Petitioner, 
as his actions do not warrant such relief. 

The application is dismissed. The implunged order of the wakf tribunal is 
affirmed. 

No cost.
