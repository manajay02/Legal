Judgment 

R. Gurusinghe 

The  petitioner  by  an  amended  petition  dated  09-02-2021seeks  inter  alia  to 
vary  and/or  set  aside  the  judgment  and  interlocutory  decree  dated  15-02-
2010 and the order dated 23-05-2014 and all the proceedings of the District 
Court  of  Balapitiya  Case  No.  3811/P,  permit  the  petitioner  to  intervene  in 
the above case, make an appropriate order allotting the undivided 1/4th and 
1/24th shares to the legal heirs of late Saaru Piyasena.   

The  basis  of  the  petitioner's  application is  that  the  undivided  1/4th  and  the 
undivided 1/24th shares of the land sought to be partitioned in the partition 
action  no.  3811/P,  in  the  District  Court  of  Balapitiya  were  owned  by  her 
father,  Saaru  Piyasena.    That  action  was  proceeded  without  making  Saaru 
Piyasena’s heirs, parties to the action.  Learned District Judge allocated the 
rights of Saaru Piyasena to the 11th defendant respondent. 

The  documents  and  the  evidence  revealed  that  one  Wickrama  Martin  De 
Soysa sold a 1/4th share of the land called Moonamalgahawaththa to Saaru 
Piyasena by deed no. 4301 dated 30-08-1962 attested by Hewamana Gilbert 
Hewawitharana,  Notary  Public.  That  deed  was  registered  at  Division  3, 
Volume 372, and folio 194 at the Balapitya Lands Registry. 

Saaru Piyasena transferred the undivided 1/4th and 1/24th share to the 11th 
defendant  by  deed  No.  512  dated  12-12-1988,  attested  by  Ranjani 
Ekanayake  Kalupahana,  Notary  Public.  When  this  action  was  taken  up  for 
trial, the 11th defendant did not have the deed number. 4301 dated 30-08-
1962  attested  by  Hewamana  Gilbert  Hewawitharana,  Notary  Public.  
However,  in  his  statement,  the  11th  defendant  stated  that  Saaru  Piyasena 
was the owner of the undivided 1/4th share and 1/24th share of the land.  In 
paragraph  11  of  the  statement  of  claim  of  the  11th  defendant,  he  said  that 
the  undivided  1/4th  and  1/24th  share  owned  by  Saaru  Piyasena  was 
transferred  to  him  by  deed  no.  512  dated  12-12-1988.    The  parties  did  not 
challenge the two deeds referred to above.  The petitioner has not challenged 
Deed No. 512 referred to above.

As described above, Saaru Piyasena had transferred all his rights to the 11th 
defendant by deed no. 512 dated 12-12-1988.  Saaru Piyasena did not have 
any rights to the land at the time of his death.   As a result, the children of 
Saaru Piyasena will get no rights, and therefore, they are not considered as 
necessary parties to the action.  Even if the petitioner had been made a party 
to the action, she would not have received any share of the land. 

The petitioner was not a party to the partition action. 3811/P.  A relief under 
Restitutio-in-Integrum can be sought only by the parties to the action.  Even if 
this  application  is  treated  as  an  application  for  revision,  the  petitioner  has 
filed  this  application  to  set  aside  the  judgment  entered  in  2010,  after  10 
years. The petitioner, has not satisfactorily explained the delay.   

The  parties  have  taken  up  several  other  objections  to  the  petitioner’s 
application.    However,  I  will  not  deal  with  all  those  objections  because  the 
petitioner’s application cannot succeed on the merits. 

For the reasons stated above, the application of the petitioner is dismissed.
