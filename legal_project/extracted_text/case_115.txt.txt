K. P. FERNANDO, J. 

The  Petitioner  is  seeking  an  order  to  transfer  the  case  No.  8570/M/2023 

(hereinafter  will  be  referred  to  as  the  matter)  from  the  Magistrate  Court  of 

Kaduwela to the District Court of Colombo for the reasons alleged in the petition 

dated 9.9.2024. 

THE FACTUAL MATRIX:  

When  the  matter  was  called  on  2.1.2024,  a  proxy  was  filed  by  Ms.  Achini  A. 

Suriyaarachchi  ,  AAL  on  behalf  of  the  Respondent  and  the  District  Court  was 

informed that one Ashan Fernando, Attorney-at-Law who is the husband of the 

Learned  District  Judge  (LDJ)  of  Kaduwela  is  appearing  for  the  Respondent; 

following this discovery, the LDJ directed that instructions be obtained from the 

Judicial  Service  Commission  (JSC)  for  the  appointment  of  a  new  judge  in  her 

place  and  rescheduled  the  case  for  31.05.2024;  JSC  by  its  letter  dated 

25.03.2024  appointed  the  Learned  Magistrate  of  Kaduwela  as  the  additional 

2 

 
 
 
District  Judge  to  preside  over  the  case  in  issue;  accordingly,  the  case  was 

transferred from the District Court to the Magistrate Court where the additional 

District Judge presides; when the matter was called on 31.05.2024, before the 

LDJ  who  is  currently  presiding  over  the  Magistrate  Court,  the  Respondent 

requested additional time to file an answer; consequently, the matter was fixed 

for  the  filing  of  the  Answer  on  28.06.2024;  Respondent  filed  Answer  on 

28.06.2024 claiming a cross claim for a sum of Rs. 500 million; accordingly, the 

matter was fixed for 27. 09.2024 for the Replication.  

THE REASONS GIVEN BY THE PETITIONER TO TRANSFER THE CASE TO 

ANY DISTRICT COURT OF COLOMBO: 

a.  The learned Magistrate is burdened with a significant number of pending 

cases in the Magistrate Court and heavy caseload indisputably delays the 

timely and efficient resolution of the current matter; 

b.  The present case involves intricate legal and factual issues pertaining to 

civil law rendering it a complex matter that requires the presiding judge 

to have thorough understanding and knowledge of the said discipline of 

law; since the learned Magistrate is more familiar with criminal law, it is 

essential that this case be heard before a Court with the necessary 

resources and expertise to adjudicate it efficaciously; 

c.  The geographical location and the superior facilities of the District Court 

of Colombo provide a more accessible and accommodating environment 

for all parties, thereby enhancing the overall efficacy of the legal process 

UNDER WHAT CIRCUMSTANCES AN ACTION COULD BE TRANSFERRED 

FROM ONE COURT TO ANOTHER? 

Section 46(1) of the Judicature Act, insofar as relevant to this application, 

reads as follows: “Whenever it appears to the Court of Appeal- 

(a) That a fair and impartial trial cannot be had in any particular court or 

place; or 

(b) That some questions of law of unusual difficulties are likely to arise; or  

3 

 
(c)  That a view of the place in or near which any offence is alleged to have 

been committed may be required for the satisfactory inquiry into or trial of 

the same; or  

(d) That it is so expedient on any other ground,  

The court may order upon such terms as to the payment of costs or otherwise as 

the said court thinks fit, for the transfer of any action, prosecution, proceeding or 

matter pending before any court to any other court”   

In terms of Section 46 of the Judicature Act No. 2 of 1978 and Section 10 of 

the Civil Procedure Code, an action could be transferred under following 

circumstances: 

a.  A fair and impartial trial cannot be had in the particular court or place; 

or 

b.  Some questions of law of unusual difficulties are likely to arise; or  

c.  A view of the place in or near which any offence is alleged to have been 

committed may be required for the satisfactory inquiry into or trial of the 

same; or 

d.  Any other expedient ground. 

The power of the District Court has been described in Chapter IV and Chapter 

V read with Section 5(2)   of the Judicature Act. 

In terms of Section 6 and 8 of the Judicature Act, Judicial Service Commission 

has full powers to appoint judges and additional judges to all District Courts. 

In  terms  of  Section  8(2)  of  the  Judicature  Act,  every  additional  District  Judge 

shall  exercise  all  the  powers  or  jurisdiction  vested  in  the  District  Court 

respectively  of  the  district  or  the  division  as  the  case  may  be,  for  which  such 

additional District Judge is so appointed. 

It was the contention  of the learned  President’s  Counsel for the Petitioner that 

the Additional  District Judge appointed to hear the matter has less experience 

4 

 
in  Civil  Law.  The  Petitioner  claims  that  the  Additional  District  Judge  lacks 

sufficient experience in civil law, as stated in paragraph 8(b) of the petition.  

In response, the Respondent submitted the Seniority List of the Judicial Service 

of Sri Lanka as of 01.07.2024, highlighting that the Additional District Judge is 

ranked 24th.  

Therefore,  her  experience  cannot  be  reasonably  challenged.  Additionally,  the 

Respondent emphasizes that a trial judge's experience cannot be a valid reason 

for transferring a case from one court to another. 

In  any  event,  the  decision  to  appoint  the  said  Judge  by  the  Judicial  Service 

Commission has not been challenged. 

Moreover, experience and/or exposure to Civil Law of a trial judge shall not be a 

ground to transfer a case from one court to another court. The remedy lies with 

the  appealing  against  any  incidental  order  and/or  judgment  delivered  by  the 

Judge.  

If  this  application  is  granted  based  on  the  Additional  District  Judge's  lack  of 

experience,  it  would  set  a  precedent  for  numerous  similar  applications  from 

parties dissatisfied with a judge or unhappy with the continuation of their case 

before them, seeking to have the case transferred elsewhere. 

IS THERE ANY LIKELYHOOD THAT QUESTIONS OF LAW OF UNUSUAL 

DIFFICULTY TO BE ARISED? 

The Petitioner submits that, (a) The plaint is grounded on three distinct causes 

of action, which involve complex legal principles concerning defamation, injury 

to  dignity,  and  the  right  to  privacy;  The  Petitioner’s  claim  arises  from  the 

publication of doctored videos and photographs falsely alleging intimate conduct 

with a dog, thereby burdening the Petitioner with the responsibility to prove the 

allegations,  including  through  expert  evidence;  (b)  The  issues  raised  in  these 

causes of action require specialized expertise in civil law and necessitate a court 

equipped  with  the  appropriate  judicial  resources  to  ensure  an  efficient  and 

5 

 
thorough resolution. The Magistrate’s Court of Kaduwela, however, is exclusively 

vested with jurisdiction to hear criminal matters under the Judicature Act. (c) to 

the  best  of  his  knowledge,  this  is  the  first  case  in  Sri  Lanka  where  causes  of 

action based on delictual principles of "dignitas" and the "right to be left alone" 

are  being  contested  in  a  District  Court.  This  clearly  falls  under  limb.  "b"  of 

Section  46  of  the  Judicature  Act  and  Section  10  of  the  CPC,  as  it  involves  a 

question  of  law  of  unusual  difficulty.  (d)  The  potential  prejudice  in  these 

proceedings would  deprive him of  a fair trial, thereby violating limb (a) of  both 

Section 46 of the Judicature Act and Section 10 of the CPC, which safeguard the 

right  to  a  fair  and  impartial  trial,  as  guaranteed  by  Article  13(3)  of  the 

Constitution. (e) due to the complex legal issues involved, he is entitled to seek 

a transfer order by demonstrating sufficient grounds, as set out in Section 46 of 

the Judicature Act and Section 10 of the CPC. 

It is presumed that all the judges are competent enough to hear any kind of case 

which come before them. The JSC has appointed the learned Magistrate to hear 

this case. Thus, there is no basis to transfer this case to another Court 

If causes of action based on delictual principles of "dignitas" and the "right to be 

left  alone"  are  being  contested,  it  is  the  duty  of  the  plaintiff’s  lawyers  to  raise 

correct issues on those lines and draw the attention of the Court to the relevant 

areas of law. Furthermore, it was not submitted as to alleged complex questions 

of law of which will be placed before the Court.  Without such elaboration, it is 

speculative to decide that this case involves difficult questions of law which the 

appointed Judge is not competent to handle. 

The  Petitioner  has  provided  no  evidence  comparing  the  caseloads  of  Colombo 

and Kaduwela courts, nor shown that Kaduwela courts lack the necessary legal 

expertise or resources. In this instance, it should be noted that if the Magistrate 

Court lacks any resources, it is always possible for the learned Magistrate to sit 

in the District Court bench provided that regular work of the District Courts  is 

not hampered.  

6 

 
The Petitioner, through the counter affidavit/objection, contends that the matter 

should  be  re-transferred  to  the  District  Judge  of  Kaduwela.  In  response,  the 

Respondent submits that, under Section 49 of the Judicature Act, once a District 

Judge  has  declined  to  hear  a  case  due  to  personal  reasons,  and  unless  both 

parties consent, the District Judge is not competent to exercise jurisdiction over 

the case. 

In the above circumstances, the Petitioner’s stated reasons do not meet the legal 

threshold  for  a  case  to  be  transferred  under  Section  46  of  the  Judicature  Act, 

No.  2  of  1978  or  Section  10  of  the  Civil  Procedure  Code.  Specifically,  the 

Petitioner  has  not  shown  that  a  fair  trial  is  impossible  or  that  complex  legal 

issues will arise, or that any other valid ground for transfer exists. 

Accordingly, the Petition is dismissed without costs. 

                                                                    Judge of the Court of Appeal 

M.T. Mohammed Laffar, J. (Act.P/CA)
