Damith Thotawatte, J. 

As  per  B  Report  dated  09-03-2024  (Annexed  to  the  Petition  marked  as  P2)  filed  by  the  1st 
Respondent  in  the  Magistrate  Court  of  Morawaka  under  case  number  25822,  a  team  of  police 
officers headed by the 1st Respondent, acting on information received by them on 08-03-2024 had 
taken one Hewapathiranage Danushka Prabath into custody whilst he was transporting 20 grams of 
heroin. 

Based  on  the  information  provided  by  Danushka  Prabath  regarding  the  Petitioner’s  alleged 
involvement  in  heroin  trafficking,  the  police  used  Danushka  Prabath’s  mobile  phone  to  call  the 
Petitioner, luring him to their location. As a result of this call, the Petitioner arrived at Hulandawa 
Junction, where he was arrested at 1:30 PM on 08-03-2024 for being in possession of 20 grams of 
heroin. 

The Petitioner had been produced before the learned Magistrate on 09-03-2024. As per the court 
proceedings (copy Annexed to the Petition marked as P3), the learned Magistrate after considering 
the B Report, ordered the remand of the accused enabling further investigations.  

It is the position of the Petitioner that he was arrested between 7.00 am and 8.00 am on the 08-03-
2024 at Matara whilst riding a motorcycle and he did not have any narcotics or prohibited substance 
in his possession at the time of arrest. The Petitioner further claims that he was subsequently brought 
to  the  Pitabeddera  Police  Station  at  about  10.00  am.  The  Petitioner  further  states  that  the  1st 
Respondent has concocted and fabricated a case against him and as such, his arrest is illegal and 
ultra vires the powers of the 1st Respondent. 

The Petitioner has filed this present Application seeking, inter alia, the following reliefs: 

(a)  Grant and issue a writ of certiorari quashing the decision to and the arrest of the Petitioner. 

(b) Grant and issue a writ of certiorari quashing the order to remand the Petitioner made by the 

Magistrate of Morawaka on 09-03-2024 in case no: B/25822. 

(c)  Grant  interim  relief  releasing  the  Petitioner  on  bail  and/or  make  order  releasing  the 

Petitioner from remand custody under conditions as may be deemed fit by Court.

The Prayer (b) above refers to a judicial act. However, it is the contention of the Petitioner that all 
consequential acts to his arrest are also illegal on the illegality of the original arrest. 

In order to substantiate the above position, the Petitioner has submitted that,  

(a)  He (the Petitioner) left his home on 08-03-2024 in response to calls he received from mobile 

phone No. 0774303603 from one Danushka Prabath.  

(b) Danushka  Prabath  made  three  calls  from  his  wife’s  phone  to  the  Petitioner’s  phone  No. 

0768206002. 

Call Details  from  08-03-2024 6.00 am  to  09-03-2024 6.00 am  of Petitioner’s  phone No. 

0768206002 (call record annexed marked as P9) reflects only 03 calls. All three calls are 

from  phone  No.  0774303603.  The  call  details  or  subscriber  details  of  phone  No. 

0774303603 are not available to determine the  Petitioner's  contention that the calls were 

given by Danushka Prabath using his wife’s phone. 

(c)  The Petitioner claims  that he called “Darshana“(Erabaddagoda Nekathige Darshana), his 

brother-in-law, on mobile phone No. 0715728412 (call record annexed marked as P4) using 

the 1st Respondent’s official mobile phone No. 0718591451 to make arrangements for the 

motorcycle which he was riding at the time of arrest. 

According to the service provider, phone No. 0715728412 is registered to Ms. E.N. Darshana. The 
call  record  marked  P4  indicates  an  incoming  call  to  phone  no  0715728412  from  phone  No. 
0718591451 and at about 7.24 am and another outgoing call to the same number at approximately 
7.30 am.  

The  Petitioner  has  attached  two  affidavits  from  Erabaddagoda  Nekathige  Darashana  and  Sudda 
Namage Chathura Tharanga, both of whom claim to be brothers-in-law of the Petitioner. 

Without considering the narration provided by the Petitioner with the support of the two affidavits, 
the  phone  records  taken  in  isolation  do  not  support  the  Petitioner's  version  of  events.  The  facts 
submitted by the affidavits are essential to support the Petitioner's position. However, these facts 
not accepted by the Respondents and as such, are disputed facts. When there is a serious dispute on 
material  facts,  untested  evidence,  even  if  submitted  through  affidavits,  cannot  be  considered  as 
uncontroverted facts. 

In F. Haffmann-La Roche Ltd. & Another vs. National Medicines Regulatory Authority & 
Others, CA Writ 98/2016, CA Minutes of 22nd June 2016, the Court of Appeal highlighted the 
limitations of resolving major factual disputes solely based on affidavits. 

Considering  the  Police  Bail  Report  annexed  to  the  Petition  marked  as  P8B,  it  appears  that  the 
position of the police is contrary to that of the Petitioner and that the police are conducting further 
investigations under the supervision of the relevant Magistrate.

In  Hettiarachchige  Jayasooriya  Vs.  N.  M.  Gunawathie  and  others,  CA  Writ  63/2015,  CA 
Minutes at 26.09.2019,  his Lordship, Justice Janak De Silva held, 

“The rationale is that where the major facts are in dispute and the legal result of the 
facts is subject to controversy it is necessary that the questions should be canvassed in 
a suit where parties would have ample opportunity of examining the witnesses so that 
the Court would be better able to judge which version is correct.” 

In  Public  Interest  Law  Foundation  v.  Central  Environmental  Authority  CA  Writ 
527/2015 decided on 24.02.2020 his Lordship, Justice Mahinda Samayawardhena has also 
held  that,  in  exercise  of  writ  jurisdiction  the  court  cannot  decide  on  administrative 
decisions where the facts involved are in dispute. 

In Thajudeen v Sri Lanka Tea Board and Another (1981) 2 SLLR 471 it was held: 

 “Where  the  major  facts  are  in  dispute  and  the  legal  result  of  the  facts  is  subject  to 
controversy  and  it  is  necessary  that  the  questions  should  be  canvassed  in  a  suit  where 
parties would have ample opportunity of examining the witnesses so that the Court would 
be better able to judge which version is correct, a writ will not issue”. 

On the above grounds, I conclude that this Court is unable to grant the relief sought by the Petitioner 
as the Application for relief is based on facts in dispute. 

When this matter was supported on 31-01-2024, the learned State Counsel appearing for the 4th 
Respondent  took  up  a  preliminary  objection  on  the  ground  that  there  was  an  unexplained  and 
inordinate  delay  in  seeking  relief  and  as  such,  the  Petitioner  is  not  entitled  to  maintain  this 
Application. 

In Jayaweera Vs. Asst. Commissioner of Agrarian Services Ratnapura and another (1996) 2 
SLLR 70 his Lordship, Justice Jayasuriya held that, 

"A Petitioner who is seeking relief in an application for the issue of a Writ of Certiorari is 
not entitled to relief as a matter of course, as a matter of right or as a matter of routine. 
Even if he is entitled to relief, still the Court has a discretion to deny him relief having 
regard  to  his  conduct,  delay,  laches,  waiver,  submission  to  jurisdiction  -  are  all  valid 
impediments which stand against the grant of relief.” 

Above position has been reiterated in Seneviratne Vs. Tissa Bandaranayake and another (1999) 
2 SLLR 341. In Dissanayake Vs. I. O. K. G. Fernando and another (1968) 71 NLR 356 it was 
held that, where there has been a delay in seeking relief by way of Certiorari, it is essential that the 
reasons for the delay should be set out in the papers filed in the Supreme Court. 

In the case of Hopman and others Vs. Minister of Lands and Land Development and others, 
(1994) 2 SLLR 240 it was held that, "The appellants have failed to give a satisfactory explanation 
for their conduct and the delay in making their application to the Court of Appeal and hence that 
Court cannot be faulted for exercising its discretion against the issue of the writ." 

4 

 
 
The Petitioner was taken into custody on 08-03-2024. And he has been placed in judicial custody 
from  09-03-2024.  Up  till  30-09-2024,  there  is  no  indication  that  the  Petitioner  has  brought  the 
matter of illegal arrest to the attention of the Court. The Petitioner has not explained the reason for 
the  delay  in  his  Petition  (amended  Petition  tendered  on  16-10-2024)  and  has  not  submitted  any 
acceptable reason for the delay in seeking relief regarding the purported illegal arrest.    

In the circumstances, I take the view that the Petitioner has not made out a prima facie or an arguable 
case  and  this  Court  is  unable  to  grant  any  relief  as  prayed  for  in  the  prayer  of  the  Petition. 
Accordingly, I decide to refuse issuance of formal notice on the Respondents of this Application.  

Application dismissed. 

Dhammika Ganepola, J. 

I agree.
