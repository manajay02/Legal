MOHAMMED LAFFAR, J. (President of The Court of Appeal- Actg) 

The  Petitioner  seeks,  inter  alia,  a  writ  of  quo  warranto  to  declare  that  the 

election  of  the  1st  Respondent  as  a  Member  of  Parliament  is  invalid  and  that 

the  1st  Respondent  is  not  entitled  to  hold  the  office  of  Member  of  Parliament. 

Additionally,  the  Petitioner  seeks  a  writ  of  prohibition  against  the  1st 

Respondent, preventing him from sitting and voting in Parliament. 

When  this  matter  was  taken  up  for  support  on  17/02/2025,  the  learned 

President’s Counsel for the 1st Respondent and the learned Additional Solicitor 

General  (ASG)  for  the  3rd  Respondent  raised  preliminary  legal  objections 

regarding  the  maintainability  of  this  application.  By  consent,  this  Court 

decided  to  dispose  of  the  preliminary  legal  objections  by  way  of  written 

submissions. 

The 1st Respondent was elected as a Member of Parliament for the Kurunegala 

District and was subsequently appointed as the Minister of Public Security and 

Parliamentary  Affairs.  While  serving  in  this  capacity,  the  1st  Respondent  was 

also appointed as the Chief of Staff to the President. 

The  Petitioner  contends  that  the  1st  Respondent  is  disqualified  from  being  a 

Member  of  Parliament  under  Article  91(1)(d)(viii)  of  the  Constitution  of  the 

Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka.  

Under  Article  91(1)(d)(viii)  and  Article  91(1)(e)  of  the  Constitution,  a  public 

officer is disqualified to be elected as a member of parliament or to sit and vote 

in Parliament, which reads thus; 

Page 2 of 4 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(1) No person shall be qualified to be elected as a Member of Parliament or 

to sit and vote in Parliament (d) if he is - 

(viii)  64[a  public  officer  or  a  member  of  the  Sri  Lanka  State  Audit  Service 

holding  any  office]  created  after  November  18,  1970,  the  initial  of  the 

salary scale of which is, on the date of the creation of that office, not less 

than  the  initial  of  the  salary  scale  applicable,  on  that  date,  to  an  office 

referred  to  in  item  (vii)  or  such  other  amount  per  annum  as  would,  under 

any subsequent revision of salary scales, correspond to the first-mentioned 

initial, 

It is abundantly clear that when the 1st Respondent was elected to Parliament, 

he  was  neither  a  public  officer  nor  serving  as  Chief  of  Staff  to  the  President. 

Therefore,  his  subsequent  appointment  to  this  position  cannot  retroactively 

disqualify  him  from  membership  in  Parliament.  The  constitutional  test  of 

eligibility applies strictly to the candidate's qualifications at the time of election, 

not to offices they may later assume during their parliamentary term. 

The 1st Respondent's membership in Parliament cannot be challenged through 

quo warranto merely because he later assumed the honorary position of Chief 

of  Staff.  It  is  pertinent  to  note  that  the  Petitioner  has  not  challenged  the  1st 

Respondent's subsequent appointment as Chief of Staff, if at all, the validity of 

his  appointment  as  Chief  of  Staff,  not  his  election  as  MP,  ought  to  have  been 

challenged separately, as the two are distinct and separate matters. To couple 

them  would  amount  to  an  improper  retroactive  application  of  constitutional 

disqualifications. 

Since  the  1st  Respondent  was  fully  qualified  under  the  Constitution  and 

existing  laws  when  elected  to  Parliament,  issuing  a  writ  of  quo  warranto  to 

nullify  his  election  would  unjustly  override  the  democratic  will  of  the  voters. 

Such  an  action  would  undermine  fundamental  democratic  principles  by 

disregarding  the  valid  electoral  mandate  granted  to  him  at  the  time  of  his 

election, despite his subsequent appointment.

It  must  be  noted  that  the  1st  Respondent's  appointment  as  Chief  of  Staff  was 

expressly  made  on  an  honorary  basis,  as  confirmed  by  the  presidential 

appointment  letter  dated  14/02/2025,  which  explicitly  excludes  any  salary, 

allowances,  or  official  benefits.  This  honorary  character  is  decisive  in 

determining that the position does not constitute a 'public office' under Article 

91 of the Constitution for three fundamental reasons. 

Firstly, an honorary appointment lacks the essential attributes of a permanent 

public  office.  It  carries  no  remuneration,  no  fixed  tenure,  and  no  statutory 

duties that would integrate the holder into the formal structure of government 

service.  

Secondly,  the  absence  of  remuneration  places  it  outside  the  constitutional 

threshold  for  disqualification  under  Article  91(1)(d)(viii),  which  specifically 

references positions with designated salary scales.  

Thirdly,  honorary  positions  by  their  very  nature  are  transient  and  advisory, 

without legal permanence or accountability that characterizes public offices. 

For  the  foregoing  reasons,  the  preliminary  objections  are  upheld.  I  hold  that 

there  is  no  merit  in  this  application  and  the  Petitioner  failed  to  establish  a 

prima facie case. Thus, the notices are refused, and accordingly the application 

is dismissed without costs. 

Application dismissed. No cost.
