Decided on:       14. 05. 2025    

MOHAMMED LAFFAR, J. (President of The Court of Appeal- Acting) 

The  Petitioners  are  seeking  a  mandate,  inter  alia, in  the  nature  of  a  writ  of  certiorari 
quashing  the  decisions  of  the  Respondents  to  detain  the  four  containers  of  sugar 
declared  in  CUSDEC/CBHQI13425  marked  P2  and  quashing  the  decision  to  impose 
charge,  levy  and  demurrage  charges  in  respect  of  the  said goods.  The  Petitioners  are 
further seeking a writ of mandamus directing the Respondents to release the said good 
to the Petitioners. The Petitioners are seeking interim orders suspending the decision of 
the Respondents to detain the four containers of sugar pending the final determination 
of this application, and release the said goods to the Petitioner subject to a reasonable 
security. 

On  30.04.2025  we  heard  the  learned  Counsel  for  the  Petitioners  in  support  of  this 
application and the learned Deputy Solicitor General appeared on behalf of the State. 

On 02.01.2025, the Petitioners imported four containers of white sugar. Accordingly, on 
07.01.2025, the 1st Petitioner submitted the relevant customs declaration for the said 
consignment.  The  1st  Petitioner  also  paid  customs  duties  amounting  to  Rs. 
5,252,950.00 at the rate applicable to white sugar.

Sri Lanka Customs obtained a report from the Sri Lanka Standards Institution (SLSI), 
which  confirmed  that  the  consignment  in  question  consisted  of  white  sugar,  and 
therefore recommended its release (Vide documents marked P5 and P6). Despite this, 
Sri  Lanka  Customs  sought  a  second  opinion  from  the  Sugarcane  Research  Institute. 
The report issued by the Sugarcane Research Institute, dated 13.02.2025 and marked 
as R6, stated that the consignment did not consist of pure white sugar, but rather raw 
sugar.  The  Petitioners  contend  that  once  the  SLSI,  the  competent  authority  for 
standards, confirmed that the four containers met the SLS 191 specification for white 
sugar and recommended their release, Sri Lanka Customs had no legal authority within 
the framework of the law to disregard that report and seek a second analysis from the 
Sugarcane Research Institute. 

Document  marked  P3  is  the  Gazette  Notification  dated  17.05.2024,  which  sets  out 
regulations relevant to the issues at hand. In terms of Rule No. 03 and Rule No. 08(c) of 
the said regulations, Sri Lanka Customs shall not release goods without obtaining the 
approval of the Director General of the Sri Lanka Standards Institution (SLSI). The SLSI 
is the designated authority responsible for testing samples of goods. And in pursuant to 
the said Gazette Notification, regulations, and the specifications relating to sugar and 
sugar confectionery marked as P4, the SLSI has submitted its report confirming that 
the  consignments  in  dispute  consist  of  white  sugar  and,  accordingly,  recommended 
their release. 

In these circumstances, Sri Lanka Customs has no lawful basis to withhold the release 
of the goods. There are no rules, regulations, or legal provisions that empower Customs 
to obtain a second testing report from the Sugarcane Research Institute, especially when 
a conclusive report has already been issued by the competent authority the Sri Lanka 
Standards  Institution  (SLSI).  The  regulations,  including  those  set  out  in  the  Gazette 
Notification dated 17.05.2024, make it explicitly clear that the approval of the Director 
General of the SLSI is a prerequisite for the release of such goods, and that the SLSI is 
the designated authority for testing and certifying standards. 

A reasonable and unavoidable question arises as to what prompted Sri Lanka Customs 
to disregard the SLSI report and seek a second opinion from another institution that is 
not empowered by law to make such determinations? The report issued by the SLSI was 
made in compliance with the applicable laws and regulations and confirmed that the 
consignment was white sugar as per the SLS 191 specification.  

When  two  reports  are  before  the  Respondents,  they  are  not  at  liberty  to  arbitrarily 
choose  between  them.  They  are  bound  to  act  on  the  report  that  has  been  lawfully 
obtained  through  the  proper  regulatory  process.  In  this  case,  the  SLSI  report  clearly 
falls within that category. 

Moreover,  the  act  of  seeking  a  second  report  after  receiving  a  clear  recommendation 
from the lawful authority raises legitimate concerns. The conduct of Sri Lanka Customs 
in disregarding a valid report without any statutory basis may give rise to suspicion that 
the decision was influenced by considerations external to the regulatory framework. 

This  Court  is  mindful  of  the  fact  that  the  consignment  in  question  consists  of  a 
perishable good that has not been released by Sri Lanka Customs for over four months.

If not released immediately, the goods are at risk of perishing and becoming unfit for 
use.  Therefore,  an  urgent  necessity  arises  to  facilitate  the  release  of  the  goods,  as 
continued delay would result in material prejudice to the Petitioners and unnecessary 
waste. 

Having carefully examined the Petition, the accompanying affidavit, the documents filed, 
and the submissions made by both Counsel, this Court is of the view that this is a fit 
and proper case to issue notices on the Respondents. Accordingly, notices are issued on 
the Respondents. 

Furthermore, interim orders as prayed for in paragraphs (g), (h), and (i) of the prayers 
to  the  Petition  are  also  granted.  However,  prior  to  the  release  of  the  four  containers 
containing  the  sugar  consignment  declared  in  the  said  CUSDEC,  the  Petitioners  are 
directed to furnish a bank guarantee in the sum of Rs. 2,000,000.00 (Two Million) in 
favour of Sri Lanka Customs. 

Upon receipt of the said bank guarantee, the Respondents are directed to release the 
four containers forthwith.
