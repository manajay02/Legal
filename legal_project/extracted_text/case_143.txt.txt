iii.  Directing the 9th respondent to forthwith suspend the Order dated 

11.03.2025 to impose travel ban on the Petitioner in the said case; 

Or alternatively, 

iv.  Directing  one  or  more  or  all  1st  to  9th  Respondents  to  forthwith 

inform the Immigration Controller to stop acting on the Order dated 

11.03.2025 to impose travel ban on the 3rd suspect (Petitioner); 

v. 

Directing the Respondents to prevent from arresting the Petitioner 

(3rd suspect) in the said case. 

THE PETITIONER’S POSITION as per the Petition-dated 07.04.2025 

The  Petitioner  operates  a  computer  game  shop  named  PS World  and  is  the 

sole financial provider for his family. He claims to have been wrongfully named 

as the third suspect in Additional B Reports in Case No. 2893/25, asserting 

that there is no credible evidence linking him to the alleged offense. He further 

explains that, due to limited access to information and time constraints, he 

was compelled to file the current application urgently. 

B Report dated 16.02.2025: 

The Petitioner states that the Police Narcotic Bureau at Katunayake Airport 

filed  a  B  Report  (No.  2893/25)  in  the  Additional  Magistrate’s  Court  of 

Negombo  regarding  the  arrest  of  a  suspect  found  in  possession  of  36 

kilograms and 152 grams of hashish, which contains cannabis sativa el. The 

initial report pertains solely to the narcotics recovered from the first suspect, 

Joseph Dhivia Ann, who arrived at the Sri Lanka Airport on flight EY 896 from 

Canada  via  Abu  Dhabi.  The  Petitioner  emphasizes  that  his  name  is  not 

mentioned in this initial report. 

Additional B Report dated 20.02.2025: 

In  a  follow-up  report,  the  fifth  Respondent  (Chief  Inspector  of  Police-Acting 

OIC-Police  Narcotic  Bureau)  revealed  that  two  additional  women  arrived 

with the first suspect and were allegedly involved in drug trafficking but 

4 

 
 
managed  to  evade  airport  security.  The  authorities  subsequently  alleged 

that a person named Ramya Chandra Mohan alias Roja—the Petitioner—was 

the mastermind behind the trafficking operation. 

The two women reportedly fled the airport in a van with the license plate 

WP JJ 0578. In this report, the van driver, Isaac Selvan Apnath Demian, 

was named as the second suspect, and a detention order was sought under 

the Poisons, Opium and Dangerous Drugs Ordinance. 

The  Petitioner  asserts  there  is  no  connection  between  himself,  the  first 

suspect, and the second suspect. He claims that the second suspect merely 

provided transport to the two women, from whom no drugs were recovered, 

and who were not arrested. The Petitioner argues that he was named in the 

additional report dated 20.02.2025 (P3) without any substantiating evidence, 

suggesting  an  attempt  to  wrongfully  implicate  him  in  a  crime  he  did  not 

commit. 

Undated Additional B Report (presumed 25.02.2025): 

According  to  the  second  suspect,  he  became  involved  at  the  direction  of  a 

friend named Chandramogan alias Roja, allegedly the Petitioner. He claimed 

he  was  instructed  by  Roja  to  pick  up  two  Canadian  women  from  the 

airport using a van. Later, he also used the Petitioner’s vehicle, license 

plate CAS 4697, to try to pick up the first suspect, who never appeared. 

The  second  suspect  then  returned  to  the  Petitioner’s  residence  as 

instructed. 

Upon  examining  the  second  suspect’s  phone,  investigators  allegedly 

found that the Petitioner had sent photos of the two Canadian women, 

which  were  later  deleted.  It  is  also  claimed  that  the  second  suspect 

attempted to tamper with evidence by deleting conversations with the 

Petitioner.  However,  the  Petitioner  contends  that  no  such  evidence  was 

presented  to  the  court  and  no  court  orders  were  obtained  to  confirm  these 

allegations. 

5 

 
Furthermore,  officers  from  the  Police  Narcotic  Bureau  (PNB)  claim  another 

individual  named  Kuresh  was  also  involved  in  the  trafficking  operation 

alongside the Petitioner. 

Additional B Report dated 11.03.2025 (Contested): 

The Petitioner states that the 6th Respondent (Women CI of police-Acting OIC 

of PNB) submitted another report on 11.03.2025, indicating that an individual 

named Roja was linked to the drug trafficking operation. Based on this, the 

3rd Respondent requested a travel ban against the Petitioner. The Petitioner 

argues that the 9th Respondent, the Additional Magistrate of Negombo, named 

him  as  the  3rd  suspect  and  imposed  the  travel  ban  without  any  credible 

evidence of his involvement in the crime. 

By  the  Statement  of  objections  of  the  2nd  Respondent  (Director,  SSP-PNB) 

dated 09.05.2025 following Preliminary Objections were raised: 

1.  The Petitioner has not presented sufficient facts to warrant the granting 

of interim relief; 

2.  The facts stated in the Petition are inaccurate and are disputed by the 

Respondent; 

3.  The Petitioner has failed to exhaust the alternative statutory remedies 

available to him. 

The  Respondent  further  argues  that  issuing  an  interim  order  to  stay  the 

Petitioner’s arrest would negatively impact the rights of other suspects who 

have  already  been  arrested  and  produced  before  the  Learned  Magistrate. 

Granting  such  an  order  would  set  an  improper  and  unlawful  precedent  by 

effectively endorsing the Petitioner’s evasion of due legal process. 

It is also stated that although the Petitioner has sought  relief under prayer 

(b)(iii) against the 9th Respondent, the proper course of action would have been 

to challenge the order of the Learned Magistrate before a different, appropriate 

forum. 

6 

 
It  is  also  pointed  out  that  the  Petitioner  himself  has  acknowledged  in  the 

Petition  that  there  is  clear  and  specific  evidence  against  the  1st  and  2nd 

suspects. Therefore, there is no basis for the Petitioner, as the 3rd suspect, to 

seek any special order from the court. 

The Respondent refers to Section 32 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and 

recent  case  law  to  argue  that  if  an  investigator  has  information  or 

reasonable grounds to believe a person has committed an offence, that 

individual may be arrested as a suspect. At that stage, the suspect is not 

entitled  to  full  disclosure  of  all  evidence  gathered  against  him;  he  is  only 

entitled to be informed of the offence for which he is being arrested. 

It  was  further  contended  that  the  Petitioner  is  attempting  to  bypass 

established  legal  procedures  by  demanding  access  to  investigative 

materials  prematurely  and  seeking  to  argue  that  there  is  insufficient 

evidence to justify his arrest. The Respondent asserts that issues such as the 

admissibility  of  evidence  are  not  relevant  at  this  stage  of  the 

investigation. 

To support the legitimacy of the ongoing investigation, the Respondent has 

attached  further  reports  (marked  as  3R1  and  3R2)  containing  specific 

investigative  materials  obtained  through  the  Learned  Magistrate.  These 

include telephone call records and WhatsApp chats between the 2nd and 

3rd suspects. These materials demonstrate that the investigation is still 

in progress and that the legal threshold required for the arrest of the 3rd 

suspect (the Petitioner) has been met. 

CONCLUSION:  

It is common ground that the Magistrate Court Case is still pending which is 

in the stage of investigation. As admitted by the Petitioner in the petition itself, 

there is specific evidence against the 1st and 2nd suspects. Therefore, there is 

no  basis  for  the  Petitioner  to  seek  an  order  from  this  Court  to  stay  the 

proceedings in Case B 2893/2025 and to stop further investigation.  

The requirement under the law is specifically provided in Section 32 of the 

Criminal Procedure Code which reads as follows: 

7 

 
When peace officers may arrest without warrant 

“32. 

(1)  Any peace officer may without an order from a Magistrate and  

         without a warrant arrest any person- 

  (a) who in his presence commits any breach of the peace; 

(b) who has been concerned in any cognizable offence or against whom a         

reasonable complaint has been made or credible information has been 

received  or  a  reasonable  suspicion  exists  of  his  having  been  so 

concerned; 

(c) having in his possession  without lawful excuse (the burden of proving 

which excuse shall lie on such person) any implement of house-breaking; 

 (d) who has been proclaimed as an offender; 

(e)  in  whose  possession  anything  is  found  which  may  reasonably  be 

suspected  to  be  property  stolen  or  fraudulently  obtained  and  who  may 

reasonably be suspected of having committed an offence with reference to 

such thing; 

(f) who obstructs a peace officer while in the execution of his duty or who 

has escaped or attempts to escape from lawful custody; 

(g) reasonably suspected of being a deserter from the Sri Lanka Army, Navy, 

or Air Force; 

(h) found taking precautions  to conceal his presence under circumstances 

which  afford  reason  to  believe  that  he  is  taking  such  precautions  with  a 

view to committing a cognizable offence; 

8 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(i) who has been concerned in or against whom a reasonable complaint has 

been  made  or  credible  information  has  been  received  or  a  reasonable 

suspicion exists of his having been concerned in any act committed at any 

place out of Sri Lanka, which if committed in Sri Lanka would have been 

punishable as an offence and for which he is under any law for the time 

being in force relating to extradition or to fugitive persons or otherwise liable 

to be apprehended or detained in custody in Sri Lanka. 

(2) Anything in this section shall not be held to interfere with or  modify the 

operation of any enactment empowering a peace officer to arrest without a 

warrant.” (the emphasis was added) 

It is clear from the above provisions that, if the investigator has information 

to believe that a person has committed and offence or if there is a reasonable 

suspicion, the Investigator can proceed to arrest that person as a suspect.  

IS  CREDIBLE  INFORMATION  RECEIVED  OR  A  REASONABLE  SUSPICION 

EXISTS  CONCERNING  THE  PETITIONER  REGARDING  THE  OFFENCE 

REPORTED TO THE MAGISTRATE? 

The 6th respondent who is the Chief Inspector of Police (IP) and Acting Officer 

in Charge of Police Narcotic Bureau has testified by way of an Affidavit marked 

2R3 and stated as follows: 

1.  Upon investigating pertaining to the 1st suspect namely Joseph Dhivia 

Ann, it was revealed that two more women holding Canadian Passports, 

namely Miller Victoria Marie (AR 508135) and Clove Rose (HM 270460) 

has arrived. 

2.  They have had drugs which is like “Hash” found from the 1st suspect; 

all  three  women  have  been  given  3  bags  consisting  “Hash”  on 

14.12.2024  at  a  place  near  Toronto  Western  Premier  Hotel  by  a 

Canadian person who is operating the drug business. 

3.  Those two women had left Sri Lanka on 17.02.2025. 

9 

 
 
 
 
 
 
4.  They have avoided security personnel and came out from the Airport; 

the person who has arrived to take these two women has been identified 

as Isac Selvan Afnath Damian-2nd suspect. 

5.  Upon  investigations  conducted  regarding  the  2nd  suspect,  it  has 

revealed that said Damian has carried out the drug business along with 

Chandra Mohan Rojahan (3rd suspect). 

6.    Upon further investigation, it was revealed that two women have gone 

to the Katunayake Airport under the direction of the 3rd suspect; those 

two women have been escorted out from the Airport by the 2nd suspect 

using the Van bearing No. JJ 0578 and given back to the 3rd suspect; 

the 2nd suspect has again gone to the Airport  by the Car bearing No. 

CAS 4697 used by Rojahan and waited until the 1st suspect who was 

taken for custody by the Customs Officials, coming out of the Airport. 

7.  Since  the  said  1st  suspect  did  not  return  from  the  Airport,  the  2nd 

suspect has returned to the Rojahan’s house. 

8.  Upon examination of the 2nd suspect’s phone, it was revealed that the 

photos of three Canadian women which has been sent to the phone has 

been deleted and conversations had with Rojahan has been erased. 

9.  A report has been called regarding deleted data from the Examiner of 

Questioned Documents by letter dated 02.04.2025 and the report is yet 

to be received. 

10. It was revealed that Rajmohan (3rd suspect) has taken the two women 

to the Shangrilla Hotel  and paid for their accommodation;  the CCTV 

images and copies of the documents relating to such facts at Shangrilla 

Hotel  are  tendered  to  the  Court  on  31.02.2025  under  PR  No. 

311/2025. 

11. After the arrest of the 2nd suspect, the 3rd suspect has left the rented-

out  house  along  with  wife  and  two  children  at  No.  10,  2nd  Lane, 

Kristuraja Mawatha, Hendela, Wattala  as stated by  the house owner. 

This proves that he has absconded. 

10 

 
It is  clearly seen that sufficient  reasonable  information relating to the drug 

offence has been revealed during the investigation and correct facts have been 

submitted to the Magistrate Court by way of B report and further reports.  

Further reports (3R1 and 3R2) submitted to the Magistrate Court has revealed 

that report relating to deleted calls and messages between the 2nd suspect and 

Petitioner  is  still  due.  The  Petitioner  must  explain  to  the  investigating 

authorities as to why the messages and calls were deleted, whether he made 

the payments to the hotel relating to two women and why he has suddenly 

left  his  usual  address  with  his  family.  It  is  common  ground  that  the 

investigations still underway.  

From the material elicited by the Further reports submitted to the Magistrate 

and the affidavits submitted to this Court, it is apparent that there is enough 

material for the investigators to arrest the Petitioner.  

They are entitled to act under Section 32 of the Criminal Procedure Code when 

credible information has been received or a reasonable suspicion exists 

of his having been so concerned.  

In the instant case, the information revealed shows that reasonable suspicion 

exists as to the Petitioner having been concerned with the offence indicated 

in the B report.  

If the Petitioner truly believes that he has been made a suspect without any 

base, he should voluntarily make a statement to the authorities get relieved 

himself. If he believes that he has unfairly been made a suspect, he is duty 

bound to give a statement as to his innocence without evading arrest.  

When the investigators are of the opinion that there is reasonable suspicion 

but  the  Petitioner  contends  that  there  is  no  reasonable  suspicion,  the 

Petitioner must explain as to why the suspicion is not reasonable. The only 

way  to  establish  his  innocence  is  to  give  Petitioner’s  statement  to  the 

investigating authorities clarifying his side of the story. Until such statement 

is given, the reasonable suspicion will prevail and the Petitioner is subject to 

arrest. It is my view that there is no material adduced for this Court to decided 

11 

 
that the Respondents acted illegally/unreasonably by naming the Petitioner 

as the 3rd suspect.  

Thus, the Petitioner has no basis to get a direction by way of a writ to quash 

and/or stay the proceedings before the Magistrate and/or get a direction to 

stop acting on the Order dated 11.03.2025 to impose travel ban on the 3rd 

suspect and/or staying the arrest of the Petitioner.  

Furthermore, in terms of the law, the Petitioner has every right to challenge 

the order of naming him as a suspect before the very Magistrate Court. If his 

application is refused, then the Petitioner can challenge the said order before 

the High Court by way of appeal or revision. Instead of invoking the alternative 

remedy provided by law, the Petitioner has chosen to invoke the discretionary 

Writ jurisdiction of this Court, which is not justifiable. Where the law provides 

a right to appeal or revisionary jurisdiction to an aggrieved party, that party 

is  precluded  from  invoking  the  discretionary  jurisdiction  without  first 

exhausting the available remedies. The Petitioner has entirely failed to satisfy 

this Court as to why he opted not to invoke such alternative remedy. In fact, 

this  conduct  shows  that  the  Petitioner  is  trying  to  evade  the  investigating 

authorities  from  taking  a  statement  from  him  which  would  certainly  reveal 

facts relating to the incident or offence impugned in the B report and further 

reports. 

For the foregoing reasons, the application for interim orders is refused, formal 

notices  are  refused  and  the  application  is  dismissed  with  cost  fixed  of  Rs. 

15,650/-. Notice refused. Application dismissed.
